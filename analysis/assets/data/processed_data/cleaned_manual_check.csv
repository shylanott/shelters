If you would like a dog that can run like the wind then she is the dog for you!  An ancient breed, they were the hunting dogs and Brooke certainly thinks she should be queen!This speed and the unusual ability to see far into the distance necessitates a fenced in yard or a place that is fenced where she can stretch those long legs of hers!

She also requests that she be the only animal in the home!   The fenced in yard is a plus, lots of toys to enjoy and destuff, her very own bed, and people who love her sensitive side!To learn more about this absolutely gorgeous gal, call Our Companions Animal Rescue at 242-9999 or e-mail daryl@ourcompanions.org~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~All of the pets promoted by Our Companions Animal Rescue are located in CT.

So, of course, I couldn't let that happen. She was fully vetted, spayed, and spent about 2 weeks in a foster home in AL with a shepherd X, who became her good friend. When she came to NY, she went to a friend who fostered her, who has an older hound X and 4 cats. When the foster mom brought her young nieces home for a weekend, Merri, as her foster mom likes to call her, was wonderful with them! There have been no problems with Merri with either the cats, the dog or with anyone new that she meets. Merri is 2 yrs. old, weighs 59 lbs, is fully housebroken, sits, and walks well on leash.

At 4 months he is 16 inches at his shoulders with big ol’ feet and ears to grow into. We don’t know his story but stairs and even being inside a house definitely seemed new to him, so his new life is all about learning and adventure and he relishes every moment of it. Rusty adores affection and makes sure he is in the middle of any cuddle session. He’s been great with his foster family including the 11 and 13 year old kids. And has let all the neighborhood kids come and love on him as well. Rusty shares his foster home with an adult dog from the same Alabama shelter and loves to play with him and learn from him. He is doing great on a leash, doesn’t have accidents in his crate, and is doing fantastic with house training. Rusty is a super cool dog and is going to bring so many laughs and kisses and snuggles to his new family - not to mention he’s quite the handsome boy.Accuracy is not guaranteed; however, information provided is accurate to the best of our knowledge.For more information on the pet, please send an email to info@aforeverhome.org",

He kept getting away from them and coming to the foster’s house.  The neighbors said he could stay.  And the foster would happily keep him; he’s a good dog.  However, this one-year-old German Shepherd mix goes after cats and doesn’t really like the foster’s other dog.  Never having been aggressive towards people, he likes people in general as he has had successful visits to the vet and other places.  We don’t know for sure about children.  He is an intelligent fella who needs some training; his foster feels that he hasn’t been trained prior to living with him.  He needs to be reminded not to jump on people when he happily greets them; he forgets that he weighs 50 pounds.

After consulting with a trainer, it does appear that Beau is mostly if not all Anatolian Shepherd. He is going to need a home that has experience with livestock guarding breeds and room for him to run. He does get along well with other dogs and cats too. He will not do well with small children as he does not like when small children are loud and jumpy. He can also be protective of his home when his family is not home. He does get very attached to his family and will do best in a home without a lot of traffic and is willing to put him away when they have visitors. While he is very friendly with everyone outside the home, he is an Anatolian and bred to guard his home. Knowledge of this breed is best for this boy. Beau is pretty much a big teddy bear with his family and is very well behaved in the house. His lumps are just fatty lipomas according to the cytology and our vet says they do not need any further treatment.Beau came to us from a shelter in Alabama. He was found as a stray and no one came to claim him. He is a very big and sweet boy. He is 103 pounds and appears to be a lab, hound with maybe something else in him too. Beau has definitely lived in a home before. He is housebroken and even gets along very well with cats. He really does seem to like being with cats and he does also seem to get along very well with other dogs. We think he is about 5-7 years old and he is very much a gentle giant. He does have some weird lumps that we have the vet checking out and all his bloodwork has come back normal. So we think this maybe normal for him. He is neutered, up to date with vaccines, microchipped and heartworm and Lyme negtive. His adoption fee is $200.00.

He weighs just under 10 pounds, and his medium coat is a beautiful white/blond color.  This boy needs some extra TLC in the form of patience and understanding.  He is extremely loving and gentle, but he is very uncertain of anyone until he gets to know them.  And once that trust occurs, this sweetheart of a boy will be glued to your side.  Polar needs a home with no small children.  He would do better in a calm home with not a lot of activity.  Perhaps a home with an older person would be best of all for him.  He’s so sweet!

She had her puppies and they have been adopted so now we need to find her a forever home. We think that Bella will do best in a home with another friendly, social dog her size and a securely fenced in yard. Bella did also test positive for heartworm, so she has been treated for her heartworm and now spayed. Please check with your vet about adopting a dog that was previously heartworm positive. Bella is still scared and insecure, but she does not have a mean bone in her body. She is very low energy and still needs to learn how to be a dog. She is a very sweet girl, but does seem to have had some abuse in the past, so a calm quiet home would be best for her.

I may not have to worry about tracking my stock market performance, but I do worry most about when my family will take me home . . .  forever.

He is very friendly, very goofy & very clumsy- a typical fun pup! He is crate trained & has had no accidents in the house, but isn’t left alone for long periods of time. He loves to get out & run/play with all the other dogs & absolutely loves water (his favorite is attacking the hose while his foster Mom is trying to water flowers). Keanu is looking for a household without young children and hustle & bustle. He will not do well living in the city of apartment - only suburb living for this guy. Keanu is neutered and up to date on his vaccines.The both would benefit from a home who has a securely fenced yard. They are in a foster home in NC and can be transported to NJ or MD for an approved adopter. ~~Husky Education And Rescue Team is a foster based rescue.

We have no idea of his parents and are simply guessing on his breeds.  Our thoughts are  that he is a mix of boxer and most likely some hound.  His coat is a beautiful dark brindle and is medium in length.  He has the boxer underbite along with the cutest face ever :-)!Rock is around 5 1/2 to 6 months old and currently weighs 37 lbs.  He will probably end up being around 60ish lbs when full grown.  He has very long legs and on the lean side.  This sweet pup is very friendly and gets along well with other dogs and cats.  House training is going very well; he walks well on a leash and knows how to sit.  We believe Rock would do best in a home with another dog and/or a family that is home often.  Rock is neutered, microchipped, up to date on vaccines (rabies, distemper & bordatella), dewormed,  and current on flea/tick/heartworm preventative.  His adoption fee is $375.

He joins us from a kill shelter in Alabama where he was found as a stray, so we don't know anything about his beginnings.Beau is around 4 1/2 months old and currently weighs 27 lbs.  We believe he is a mix of doberman pinscher and possibly some type of terrier.  He is currently being fostered with another dog and 2 cats and does well with all of them.  However, he loves his humans best and is just such a sweet pup!  His happiest times are snuggling up with people and getting belly rubs :-).    Beau does great in the crate, but still needs work on his house training.  He is also pretty good on the leash.Beau does have a mild issue with his gait in regards to his back legs.  We noticed that his gait was slightly off and seems to favor his back right leg.  We took him to our vets and did bloodwork and had x-rays done on his legs and pelvis which were sent off to a radiologist for review.  Bloodwork was completely fine and the radiologist found nothing unusual in the x-rays.  There are no indications of genetic mutations or neurological disease.  Both the radiologist and vet believe this is possibly an injury that was sustained as a young puppy involving his tendons and ligaments that have healed, however, not properly.  Beau is not in pain and may always have an \""off\"" gait.  He could be taken to a orthopedic specialist to do further testing, but it would not be necessary.  Beau is a very happy puppy and runs around and plays with the other dogs and doesn't seem to notice any difference :-)!  We hope this won't deter someone from wanting to adopt him as he is truly such a sweet, loveable puppy.Beau is current on vaccines, flea/tick/heartworm preventative and dewormings.  His adoption fee is $350.  If you are interested in the adorable puppy, please submit an application on our website at https://worthytails.rescuegroups.org.  For any questions you have about him, please send an email to jessie.wilson@comcast.net",

We rescued this girl from an overcrowded shelter in Alabama, about to go into labor. We got her to Maine on time where she gave birth to 6 beautiful babies, all of which are healthy and now ready for their forever homes. Sunny is an amazing girl who has a fun and goofy personality. She loves to play with her humans, loves stuffy toys, bones, and ropes. She enjoys going for walks and helping her human around with house work. She is friendly with most dogs as long as she is properly introduced, but should live in a home without cats as she has presented to be a little too interested.

Goose is good with dog and cats, and is a total lovebug. He is working on his leash manners, as he is a little uncertain with loud city noises. Goosey is goofy and sweet, snuggly and handsome.Some notes from his foster home:Goose is a typical young dog who needs exercise and stimulation.  He is also a big boy (around 75 lbs) and he would do best with another dog (or 2!) who is willing to run and play with him in the yard to burn off some energy.  He is willing to entertain himself (see the video here: Goose Entertains Himself with Gymnastics!).  He is fascinated with birds and butterflies, and squirrels are possibly the most exciting thing ever!Perhaps due to his time abandoned, he does show some resource guarding.  He eats in his crate at his foster home, and high-value treats like knucklebones need to be closely monitored with other dogs around.  He freely exchanges anything he has for a cookie with his foster parents.  He is very food motivated and knows sit and down, but his recall is still a work in progress.  His leash walking is improving, but if he sees a squirrel, all bets are off!If you are interested in fostering for us, please complete a PRO Volunteer Form: http://www.pointerrescue.org/volunteer.htmlWant to help but not ready to foster or adopt?

I’m about 5-6 years old. I originally came from an over-crowded shelter in Arkansas. I’m very loving and loyal. I bond closely with my humans and sometimes I can be a little over protective. I get along well with other dogs. I’m living now in a foster home with two other large dogs. I’m a little nervous about cats and children under the age of ten. I love to cuddle and sit in your lap if you let me, although I’m a little too big to be a lap dog. I love to go on long walks with my family and play with the other dogs in my house. I also really enjoy car rides. I’m potty trained and kennel trained. I know some commands like sit and come. I learn very quickly when I get rewarded with treats.

Or Gracie Lee. Or Pretty Girl. Or Big Head. Or Smooch! I have lots of nicknames because my foster mom really, really loves me. I'm a 60# Black Mouth Cur. I originally came from Arkansas and I'm 2 years old.    I love to run! When I get the zoomies in the yard, I run figure eights around the trees and it makes my mom laugh every time. I also love other dogs and would really like to have a brother or sister.    Mom says I'm very good at entertaining myself. Bones are my favorite, but I like chew toys, ropes and large outside fetch toys. Inside, I love to unstuff all the little toys, then watch mom stuff it back in, so I can rip it up again. Great fun! Ha ha!    When mom has to be away, I run right in my kennel and wait for her to come back. When she does, I do my happy dance! I can kennel at night also, but mom lets me sleep in her bed, where I snuggle under the covers and don't move until she gets up. I like to be toasty warm! I'm also an experienced couch potato, mom gives me 5 stars.    I had a very difficult start to life. I was not treated kindly and not socialized at all with people or animals. I have since learned a lot about dogs but have not met cats. I am still working on people skills. Because of the way I was treated in the past, I'm scared of people I don't know and I bark at them. I can look scary, but I'm really just unsure. Once I get to know someone, I practically drown them in kisses. I'm just slow to trust, and I get a little nervous in new situations, but I have come so, so far already and I really want to like everybody. I'm smart too. I know around 25 commands and words.    If you are the kind of person who has the love and patience to continue helping me with my social skills, I'll walk, run, play as often as you like, chill when you want to chill, and I'll love you forever.

Benny is dog and cat friendly senior boy (between 12-14), who was rescued from rural Arkansas. Benny was pulled off the street matted, dirty, blind with two infected eyes, and covered in parasites and worms. Benny has since been vetted, and has made a full recovery minus regaining his vision, (which everyone knows is not a priority for an amazing dog here at Anarchy!) Benny has been monitored closely by a very experienced foster home the last few months, and has been doing great. Benny does require daily inexpensive eye drops, and some periodic eye cleaning to keep him comfortable. Benny's favorite past times according to his foster mom are meal time, and soaking up the sun when the weather is nice. Benny is a quiet senior boy who would love to live out his remaining days in a peaceful home, with lots of affection that allows him to enjoy some fresh air from time to time.

She came to us from Arkansas where she was found nearly starved and very sick with heartworm. She has since gained weight and recovered, and recently made the journey to Rochester to find her forever home! She is full of love, kisses, and snuggles, and would love a nice family to call her own.Honor likes to play, but she likes to snuggle even more. She would prefer to be a lap dog and potato on the couch most of the day. She is not super active but she loves sunbathing and relaxing outside. She gets along well with other dogs and wouldn't mind a playmate, so long as they don't play too rough and respect her space when she's tired. No cats for this girl!Honor is crate-trained and potty trained. She has not had any accidents at her foster home and has been fine being left for a regular workday, but her medication makes her need to go potty a bit more frequently than most dogs, so a family who works shorter shifts or is available to let her out for a potty break mid-day would be ideal for her.She can be nervous around her food, so she prefers to eat alone in her crate. She is fine taking treats, even with other dogs, as long as she understands clearly who each piece is meant for. As soon as she sees dinner coming she runs to her crate and dances while she waits.Honor is a gem of a dog and will make someone very happy. Her foster parents would be keeping her if she didn't chase their cats! They say she is wonderful, affectionate, just an all-around good girl.

She is what we refer to as a \""courtesy post.\""  Volunteers with our group are sometimes contacted by friends or family who need help re-homing a dog.   That is what is going on with Maisy.  She is currently living with a family in upstate NY who is friends with a long time volunteer of Circle of Hope.  This family adopted Maisy from a rescue group in Arkansas just over ago  when she was 10 weeks old.  This family has young children and the bottom line is that she is not a good fit with them and we will not place her in a home with them. The energy level and unpredictable activities of little kids can get Maisy nervous and we aren't sure we can trust her with that.  We won't describe her as aggressive, and the best trainer in our area agrees and has said several times that she is not an aggressive dog.   She is great with teenagers and adults and loves to meet them all the time.  She also seems to love to play with other dogs. The doggie day camp she goes to says she never has had any issues.  She is energetic and brings that energy to doggie games, so maybe a home with an older dog would not be a good fit.  She also would not be good in a home with cats.Maisy is very smart, active and playful.  She would love a home with lots of activity and maybe even where she could be taught how to do a job on a farm.  She is looking for frequent engagement.  She isn't a dog who likes to hang out alone.  When left alone for a long period of time she gets nervous and bored. She really likes a routine and adult companionship that is task oriented.   She loves to play in the snow, shallow water (although not really a swimmer), tug of war and chase balls.  She is great in the car and always up for walks, jogs and hikes.  She is good on a leash, is crate trained, house broken and up to date with all of her vet care.  She is truly loved by this family she has been with, but they know their home is not the best match for her due to their young children.  If you think you have what Masiy needs and could give her that perfect home please let us know.  All interested adopters please email Cari at carilifluke@gmail.com.

His estimated date of birth is October 2016. He came to ARF from a shelter in Fort Smith after being rescued as an unclaimed stray. This sweet guy had a tough time coping with anxiety, and spent time in the medical unit because he was so scared. He is doing extremely well in a foster home after being given a chance to adjust at his own pace. He is housetrained, with a few accidents here and there. He is crate trained at night, and rests quietly when his crate is covered. Toby loves being around other dogs. He is energetic and playful, but also submissive. The two dogs in his foster home have helped his adjustment immensely. He does okay with older kids, but may not be a good fit around younger ones. He chases the cat living in his foster home, but hasn't tried to hurt her. As he has been adjusting to his foster home, he has growled and barked at the members of his foster family. However, he responds well to verbal correction, and this behavior is declining in frequency as he becomes more comfortable.Toby is very companionable and likes being around people. He follows his foster mom around the house keeping her company in various rooms. His only really bad habit is that he likes to chew, with a particular affinity for shoes and cords. This can be easily managed by providing bones and toys, and keeping human things picked up. Toby shows his Basenji heritage with unusual vocalizations in addition to little barks and growls.Toby's ideal forever home would be with a family who is patient enough to allow him to acclimate at his own pace. The perfect home for Toby will have at least one other dog, and no young kids. They will also have the ability to tolerate toileting accidents, and to remember to pick up things he's likely to chew. Toby is a smart, resilient little guy, who will be a wonderful addition to his forever family.Toby has a $150.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heartworm prevention.

I arrived with some cysts on my head that needed to be removed, and I am a little self-conscious about the scars.

We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.Dogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.Adoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.Donations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.All known information about the animal is listed above. We do our best to give accurate information, but most of our dogs are rescues and do not come with a known history.Paws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.Paws New England abides by the dog importation regulations set forth in the states of MA, CT, NH and RI.",

Love on wheels!El Niño is a 3-1/2 year old street dog from Aruba.  He was rescued by 9 Lives Aruba and they cared for him after he was found in the street after being hit by a car.  He has spinal issues and is paralyzed in the hind end.  He is high energy and wants to go..go..GO!  He self mutilated his penis and had surgery to relocate his ureter to the area where a female dog's is.  He has to have a cushion of sorts on his wheelchair and pants are worn to keep that sensitive area protected.  It is prone to irritation otherwise.  He does require his bladder to be expelled and he is incontinent of both urine and stool.  He does eat prescription food for bladder support and takes cranberry extract daily.  He came with multiple drag sores that are healing.  He was in boarding prior to his flight to the US and did poorly in that setting.  He is friendly with people and animals.  He always wants to play...  He is about 30-35 pounds.  He is alert, smart, and loving.  The Mia Foundation agreed to take him in when his loving foster home in Aruba became ill and could not continue to care for him.  They were not successful in finding a special needs foster home and reached out for help.  That is how he came to the Mia Foundation ?

He is potty and crate trained but he usually is fine left out with our resident dog during the day and night. Like most dogs, he does best meeting dogs in a neutral environment (off leash and open). He has children in his foster home who he loves and adores. When he was first settling in, he didn’t communicate in the best way, but is learning and will definitely continue to do so! Older children might be best, but with patient and knowledgeable grown-ups, Oliver could be fine w/ littler ones. Oliver loves to go on walks and has been doing better not pulling! He does have a moderate energy level so he does need exercise daily. Currently, he enjoys the fenced in yard with his foster family and resident dog. Once he notices that his people are getting tired he will settle down and curl into a tight ball either on top or right next to you. Before coming to his foster he traveled all the way from Belize! He was a stray and was severely malnourished and starving but a nice lady took him in as her own. He came to his fosters in great health, a little skinny, but a handsome fun-loving dude. Overall, little Oliver just wants a family who can give him love, snuggles, and a chance to learn all about life for a dog in America!",

I was rescued from an overcrowded California shelter, so I had to share my kennel space. I didn’t mind at all; I love to socialize with DOGS of all sizes and with CATS.My foster mom tells me that I am extremely well behaved in the home and I am proud to say I am completely HOUSE TRAINED too. Some of my favorite past times are going on walks and swimming in a little pool.  As perfect as I am, I can be protective of my food and toys, so a home with young children that try to take my stuff, isn’t the best fit for me. until i get to know them Neutered and have all my shots and microchip Please fill out this application by copying and pasting link into your browserhttps://poshpetsrescueny.org/dog-application/",

While the west coast has all the sunshine, I wanted to see how the mid-west farmers daughters lived. All the dog volunteers at Last Hope say I am the sweetest little girl, I love to snuggle, and give tons of kisses. I love to ride in the car and go for walks and I am super good at both! I am a very strong girl and need someone equally as strong. I am a princess and love all the attention so I will need to be the only pet in the house. I also need a home that has a privacy fence in case the neighbors have pets. So if you always wished they all could be California girls and wanted one of your own, then I am your girl.....Kaia’s adoption fee is $250 and includes her spay, micro chip and current vaccinations. Last Hope requires that all of our animals be kept on year round heart worm preventative and as indoor dogs only. Our adoption process includes a background check, personal and vet reference checks as well as a home visit.",

He is a very handsome and athletic guy! Look at that face! Rocky loves to play and is an active boy. He is tall and leggy! He also enjoys the company of other dogs. Rocky LOVES women, and is a bit leery of men. He has met some men he trusts and likes, but women are definitely his bag. We would love to find this wonderful guy the right home. He is currently in training with our friends at Kompletely K-9 Dog Training and Rehabilitation, so he knows all kinds of commands, so whoever adopts Rocky is getting a TRAINED dog!!!! That is a big deal! Rocky is housebroken and crate trained too! No kitties, though.Isn't there someone out there with a loving home for him? If you are an active home looking for a devoted companion, please fill out our online application to get the approval process started. We will not schedule meet and greets without an approved app on file. Here’s the link: www.miraclegsdmaine.org Please note that we will call your vet to ensure all current and prior dogs have been kept up to date on rabies and distemper at a minimum as well as annual heartworm test and a minimum of 6 mos heartworm preventative purchased per year.

She is approximately 3 years old, and super sweet.  When Saweetie was in CA she hurt her tail by wagging it too hard and it became infected, so we had it amputated.  She has the cutest little nub tail, now - it is adorable as is she.  Saweetie is quite small - only around 45-50 lbs.  She craves affection.  Saweetie has been with our trainer for a few weeks, and walks nicely on a leash, and knows several commands.  Saweetie is crate trained.  She is a little anxious so she will need a patient adopter - she craves attention and needs to gain some confidence.  She couldn't be more sweet.

He was a pound rescue at 4 months old, so we are unsure of his breed(s), but our best guess is lab/border collie. He is in need of a loving home that has no other pets and would be willing to put in the time and effort to rehabilitate him, as he is aggressive towards other dogs (the name is fitting, but wasn’t intended that way). Due to changes in our living situation and our dogs’ inability to get along, we are looking to re-home. He LOVES people and is very cuddly and sweet in the home... it’s just other dogs that are the issue with him, unfortunately. We hope to find him a new owner that can bring out the best in him and provide him with the most stress-free home possible. He is currently located in Alturas, California and we will be willing to transport him to his new owner. If you are interested in finding out more detail about him and his personality/current situation, please reach out to me (his owner, Samantha) via text or phone call at (805) 602-7332.

Bradford arrived at BrightSide from an overcrowded shelter in California with two other pups. Bradford is ready to start searching for a home of his own. Please read below to learn what Bradford needs. Bradford is a special needs adoption at this time. All three dogs came to us very under-socialized and fearful of humans. They are starting to make great progress on leash and working on their trust with humans. Bradford is starting to gain confidence on the leash but is still working on walks around the shelter. Bradford is the least trusting of humans out of the bunch and isn't seeking out attention yet. Bradford loves playing with the other pups and really relaxes and opens up around them. We think having another balanced dog will help Bradford a lot. Although Bradford is fearful, he has never tried to bite or showed any aggression whatsoever. And generally speaking he has handled everything we have needed to do with him well. However he will bolt to try to avoid humans still. He is a project dog that will require lots of training, confidence building, rehab, and patience from his new owner. It could be that Bradford will always be a bit unique but it really depends.We recommend researching what it takes to work with fearful/feral dogs. We have a couple local dog trainers in the area that we could refer anybody interested in adopting Bradford to that have some experience with dogs like him!Of course Bradford has no basic obedience training, is likely not potty trained, and will need to learn how to be brave in the big world. We hope that Bradford will continue to make progress at the shelter but are ready for him to start meeting new faces and making that perfect connection. We know it is a big commitment to adopt Bradford but he says \""I'm ready!\"" to grow and learn with his forever person. It will be a rewarding experience for his future human to learn and grow with him. If you'd like to meet Bradford, please come to the shelter and talk with us. Adoption applications are available (1) online- www.brightsideanimals.org, or (2) BrightSide Animal Center in Redmond, OR. Adoption fee includes spay/neuter, current vaccinations, microchip, free veterinary wellness visit the first week and one month of free pet insurance.",

Both pups are housebroken, crate trained, good eaters, and good with dogs. Biscuit is happy-go-lucky and loves all humans. She weighs 21 pounds, but should be around 17. Biscuit has recently been diagnosed with Cushing’s Disease, which requires daily medication for the rest of her life. Zoey is feisty and a little stand-offish at first, but warms up with time. She is really tiny at just 4 pounds. Zoey recently underwent a dental cleaning and is doing great. Zoey is not a fan of being picked up or held, but tolerates it. She enjoys lying next to you and being petted. Biscuit requires sleeping with her human (and FYI she does snore). These two pups are both precious and love each other very much. CAWS will consider separating them, but feel we first need to give them a chance to find their forever home together.

She is current on her DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies. She has been wormed and flea treated, and tested negative for heartworm.History: Sadie comes from an overcrowded shelter in California. PUP was asked to help and we are so glad we did. All dogs PUP pulls from California come with health certificates, as required by Washington state.Notes from Sadie's Foster Home:Sadie is very sweet and affectionate. She is also very playful. She loves running around the yard and playing chase. She loves her walks and is very good on leash. She’s also crate trained and will sleep in her crate at night and go in on her own when she wants her own space.She is potty trained. We keep her on a schedule and she will not potty in the house. Sadie is friendly and receptive to new people, environments, and dogs. She will let other dogs know when they’ve crossed her boundaries, encroached on her space, or are too close to her toys or treats. When we have a dog such as Sadie we make sure any high value items are not left on the floor to fight over and we also make sure she has an advocate in us. Oftentimes, dogs like Sadie think they have to fend for themselves. Knowing she has a leader that is fair and diligent, she is comfortable.We do not allow raw hide chews as even dogs who don’t fight over treats or toys will fight over raw hides. She is very polite at feeding time, sitting and waiting until given the okay to eat her food.Sadie is the sweetest little dog, with a huge personality. She is playful with good energy, but will mellow and relax when time for bed. She loves belly rubs, pets and scratches on her back and behind her ears. Believe it or not, she actually loves getting a bath; she has an affinity for the water. When on walks by the river, she will dive under the water if her foster mom doesn’t keep her away from the river’s edge.Sadie is a sweet, silly, bundle of love and a joy to have around. She is a great friend and companion. We’re looking for a home for Sadie that will step up and be a leader for her and show her she doesn’t have to fight her own battles. That she has an advocate. To teach her she doesn’t have to live on the offensive. A home that will show Sadie the love she desires and deserves.Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the dog's foster home. Although PUP provides adopters up to the minute information on our dogs, we cannot guarantee they will behave in the same manner in a different environment with new owners.ADOPTION: If you think you have room in your home and heart for this dog and you reside within Washington State, please go to our Adoption Information page, or copy and paste this link https://www.pupdogrescue.org/adopt.html in your browser.

He is current on his DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies. He has been wormed, flea treated, and tested negative for heartworm.History: Angus comes from an overcrowded shelter in California. PUP was asked to help and we are so glad we did. All dogs PUP pulls from California come with health certificates, as required by Washington state.Notes from Angus's Foster Home: Angus is a sweet, happy dog. He enjoys playing with other dogs (big or small) and he LOVES to carry around a fuzzy toy. Because of his fondness of having a dog buddy, we’re hoping to find him a home that has a resident dog already.Since he has been in our home he has become quite the little gentleman. He goes in his crate at night willingly and sleeps quietly all night long. He also eats in his crate. His energy level is in the medium range. We spend a fair amount of time outdoors but after a good romp, he is more than happy to settle in to a chair next to one of his people and snooze. Angus does enjoy barking at our cats but other than that he is pretty quiet. He’s just an all-around nice dog.Our trainer loves this little dude and has recommended a dog-savvy owner that won’t allow Angus to wrap you around his cute little paws. We had adopted him to someone who was more of a nurturer and he took total advantage of that, as dogs will sometimes do, and dictated when his walk ended by sitting down. We’re requiring our trainer speak with approved applicants so we ensure Angus has a forever home next time.Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the dog's foster home.

He is current on his DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies. He has been wormed, flea treated, and tested negative for heartworm.History: Earl comes from an overcrowded shelter in California. PUP was asked to help and we are so glad we did. All dogs PUP pulls from California come with health certificates, as required by Washington state.Notes from Earl's Foster Home: We like Earl so much that we'd like to keep all his good qualities a secret so we can enjoy fostering him for longer, but that's not really fair to Earl, so it's time to share all about him so that the fantastic family that he deserves can find him soon!Earl gets along so easily with all the people and dogs in our home and has been an easy pup to fold into our household. He's just as likely to cuddle up in a dog bed with any one of our dogs as he is to find a little spot to cuddle in next to us adults or our teen kids.Though he would honestly prefer to sleep on someone's bed each night, he does sleep quietly in his crate once he's been given the chance to snuggle up with us on the bed first and thereafter he hops into his crate and enjoys a few bites of kibble as a treat before we put a blanket over his crate and tell him goodnight.Earl has also learned to be in his crate for shorter periods in the daytime; he may fuss a bit in his crate if he knows we are home, but typically settles down in a few minutes (especially if we cover his crate). He also rides quietly crated in the car when we go for walks further from home or take him to pet-friendly places to help him see more of the world.Earl's chihuahua side comes out when he gets the chance to sun himself in the fenced backyard on a sunny day - he really loves just hanging out in the sun (or sleeping in a dog bed in a sunspot)! He is good about not barking when he sees or hears the neighbors and is overall a quiet dog.Earl enjoys taking walks alongside the other dogs in our house but is less confident when walking by himself and/or in new areas we haven't explored before. He can be shy initially in new situations but often warms up to new places and new people if he's given some time to acclimate and also given the courtesy of being able to approach new people rather than have them want to approach and pet him immediately. He has been appropriate with visitors to our home and willing to befriend people so long as we are respectful of his need to have some choice in how quickly he approaches new people. We have not seen Earl around young children or cats, so cannot say how he would behave in those situations.In case it's not already apparent, we adore Earl and his easy-going, easy to live with, snuggly ways! If you think Earl might be the sort of family member you would pick to share your life with, please let us know by filling out an application with PUP so that you can meet Earl soon.Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the dog's foster home. Although PUP provides adopters up to the minute information on our dogs, we cannot guarantee they will behave in the same manner in a different environment with new owners.ADOPTION: If you think you have room in your home and heart for this dog and you reside within Washington State, please go to our Adoption Information page, or copy and paste this link https://www.pupdogrescue.org/adopt.html in your browser.

Jacob LOVES his people and how can you help but melt into those sweet eyes of his?! He is very willing to please and make connections, often flooding you with lots of kisses. He already knows a few basic commands and is learning and benefiting from boundaries. That said, he is well-behaved and quick to follow direction. He hasn’t had much experience with kids and is still learning how to interact with cats. He likes other dogs and will occasionally play.Jacob has had a few accidents in his foster home but is proving to be housetrained. He doesn’t like the crate and will whine a bit but does eventually stop and hasn’t had any accidents in the crate. He rarely barks except when he needs to go outside. He likes walks and does fairly well on them with little to no training. He prefers to take care of his business during walks.Jacob has been known to get mischievous and would benefit from basic house rules and continued training. He would do well in a variety of families as he is easy-going and low energy with a few spurts of energy. He loves to snuggle inside and explore outside and, like most dogs, would do well with continued socialization. He is such a sweet and loving dog and will make a great addition to his new home.Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the dog's foster home.

The road, being a tempting and tempestuous mistress, has left our sweet boy rather nervous of people and his lack of confidence is a thing he’ll need help nurturing. Though clearly bred for finer things like hot dog bits and overstuffed couches, Sam yearns for affection and stability even more than fine cutlery and an evening at the opera. A good fit for Sam would be a quiet home without kids. We think he would also really enjoy (and thrive) with another canine companion and we’d love to find a family whose heart is big enough to adopt both Sam and his devoted sidekick, Dexter. Echo Glen Children's Center is a youth correctional facility located approximately 40 minutes east of Seattle. Canine Connections is a program that pairs the at-risk youth at Echo Glen with dogs that have not yet found successful placements. In this program the youth are taught how to train the dogs in basic obedience through a reward based system. Since Sam is still quite fearful of his environment, our primary goal is improving his comfort around people. He has been exhibitiing less stress around strangers with each day. .

Given my size (over 60 lbs) I would do best with a strong owner who has experience with the pitbull breed. Can you foster or adopt me?

He is current on his DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies. He has been wormed, flea treated, and tested negative for heartworm.Scott has had FHO (Femoral Head Osteotomy) surgery at some point, according to our vet, specialist, and x-rays, but as far as when he had it… that can’t be determined based on what they saw. Our vet is happy to talk with anyone scheduled to meet him, to answer all questions and set Scott up for success. We have been asked to treat him like a patient at four weeks after FHO surgery and walk Scott slowly on leash so he places that back leg on the ground and uses it, instead of lifting it up when he moves faster. Our vet team also suggest that he “swim” in a bathtub to build up those back leg muscles. He is not in any pain.History:Scottcomes from an overcrowded shelter in California. PUP was asked to help and we are so glad we did. All dogs PUP pulls from California come with health certificates, as required by Washington state.Notes fromScott's Foster Home: Scott is truly a diamond in the rough! He’s the kind of dog with a well-meaning heart that needs (and enjoys) training and boundaries. When he first got into his foster home, he was a little timid but quickly learned he was in a safe space and was comfortable.Although he doesn’t prefer his crate, he is very good in it and doesn’t have accidents or whine. He hasn’t had any accidents in the house but he did try to mark when he first got into the home and didn’t know the space. He should be monitored and worked with in any new situations.Scott also enjoys going on walks and seeing all there is to see. He is working on leash training but does really well with correction. At times, he really likes all fun things like crows or possibly other dogs, but he responds well to correction and quickly only has eyes for you. Like with most dogs, he would excel with continued socialization and training. He enjoys being outside and relaxing in the sun but really likes to be with his humans.Scott has done well with the other dogs in his foster home and should continue to be great with proper introductions. His behavior around cats or dogs is unknown. He has a medium to low energy – he is happy to go on new adventures but also enjoys relaxing with his humans in front of a good movie. He can’t wait to find his forever home soon.Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the dog's foster home. Although PUP provides adopters up to the minute information on our dogs, we cannot guarantee they will behave in the same manner in a different environment with new owners.ADOPTION: If you think you have room in your home and heart for this dog and you reside within Washington State, please go to our Adoption Information page, or copy and paste this link https://www.pupdogrescue.org/adopt.html in your browser.

Frisco will be an awesome addition to a family that can give him the attention, exercise, training and affection he deserves.Due to the fact that this is a mixed breed puppy, we, nor our vets, cannot guarantee the size that your dog will be.Health: Frisco has been neutered and microchipped. He is current on his DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies. He has been wormed and flea treated.History: Frisco was born June 2, 2018. His Mom was pregnant when rescued from a shelter in Merced, CA. Frisco and his siblings were born while in the care of their foster moms. Because he is a mixed breed we are unable to determine how big he will be once full grown.Notes from Frisco's Foster Home: Frisco is a sweet, young boy with a heart of gold. He does, however, have difficulty in new situations and takes time to build up trust with people he is unfamiliar with. Once he trusts you, he shows his playful, goofy side. Frisco gets along well with other dogs and delights in playing with them, particularly enjoying running in the yard or playing tug of war. Although he has a fairly high energy level, he has a definite quiet side and loves to sit on your lap or right beside you. He is crate trained (and willingly goes into his crate and sleeps through the night without a peep) and is housetrained on a schedule. Perhaps because of his age, he can be a chewer, so nylabones and durable toys are recommended for him. Frisco loves going on walks and does well on leash. Frisco will need an adopter who understands his need to take it slow in warming up and that will be patient with him. He would greatly benefit from being with a person or family that is active and will continue to expose him to new situations in a controlled way so that he can become comfortable with change. Because of his trust issues, we do not recommend that Frisco go to a home with children under the age of 12. In the right environment, Frisco will blossom and become a wonderful companionNote: The above description reflects the behavior weow.have observed in the dog's foster home. Although PUP provides adopters up to the minute information on our dogs, we cannot guarantee they will behave in the same manner in a different environment with new owners.Adoption: If you think you have room in your home and heart for this dog and you reside within Washington State, please go to ourAdoption Informationpage.

She is our rescue's longest resident and we don't know how we haven't found her family. She loves all people and is amazing with even very young children. She doesn't bat an eye at crazy antics or rough handling by toddlers, and is not mouthy whatsoever. All she wants in life is to be next to her people. Snuggling and following you around are her favorite activities. Brigid is crate trained and can be left crated for 8 hours without issue in a secure crate. She's house trained and knows sit, down and \""kennel up.\"" She's not mouthy or food/toy possessive, and she takes treats gently. Brigid is very anxious and reactive in the outside world, and doesn't do well meeting new dogs outside the house. She is leash reactive except when managed by an experienced handler, and will never be a dog-park dog. But she loves playing and cuddling with dogs of all genders and sizes in her own pack and will be fine living with other dogs after a slow introduction. (She needs to understand they are part of her pack before she accepts them.) Brigid doesn't need or want to go for walks for exercise but she does need a secure fenced yard to go potty. Bonus skill: She is treadmill trained!Brigid's Story: Brigid was a stray in San Bernardino and ended up at high-kill shelter. She was put on the euthanasia list when she came down with kennel cough, so we rescued her in September 2016! She was not spayed due to her upper respiratory infection and when she arrived we quickly saw she was very pregnant! After giving birth she ended up with a very serious infection that required separating her from pups so she could get the veterinary care she needed. She had to have her mammary gland removed and was in intensive medical care for some time. This was likely traumatic for her and may explain some of her separation anxiety and excited/reactive behavior around other dogs. Since then, Brigid had an injury which required surgery (TPLO) and has since recovered. She has also had an extensive board and train so she is well trained. We are eager to find Brigid a wonderful home she can call her own. She has been through a lot so she will need a patient, loving and supportive family.Adoption Info: Brigid's adoption fee of $150 includes her spay, all vaccinations (Rabies, DPPV, Bordetella) deworming, microchipping and transport from California to Seattle. Brigid's adoption will also include a home training session for her new adopters. Brigid's actual rescue costs are close to $10,000 so any donations to her care are greatly appreciated.About Foster to Adopt Program:Fosters provide a safe landing spot for dogs transitioning from the shelter environment and help prepare the dogs for adoption.

Characteristic of his breed description, Blizzard is alert and has a strong pack mentality. He has an unmatched loyalty to his humans and is friendly with new people. Blizzard is highly intelligent and loves to play with his purple ball. He is an active dog that has a knack for tricks and would likely do well with agility training.

Sadly, this little lady has probably experienced a little more life than most. As a banned breed, she lived her life in a small cage and lacked basic veterinary care. Although she looked a little rough at first, Apoquel and daily supplements have helped Martha tremendously in looking and feeling her best. In fact, she is now ready to start looking for her FURever family.Characteristic of her breed description, Martha is loyal to her humans. She bonds quickly and loves going for walks. Martha is well-behaved on leash and knows commands like sit, come, and stay. She accepts treats gently and enjoys squeaky toys. Martha is crate-trained and housebroken.

Luckily for China a Good Samaritan was able to watch over her and advocate for her so that she made it out of the kill shelter alive. China at first appeared to be terrified and confused by her sudden stroke of bad luck, one can imagine that being left for dead on the side of the road can be devastating to anyone. China is currently in our boarding facility where she had the chance to chill out and just relax after the whole terrible ordeal of being abandoned then hitting the euth list where she would’ve likely died if we didn’t step in. What we learned from China over the past few months is that she is pretty pawsome! China loves to take long drives, she’s fantastic in the car. China is also a world class ball player/chaser.   We noticed China hates the crate, so no biggie she doesn’t have to go in one if it makes her uncomfortable. China definitely came out of her shell and shown us her potential. We are seeking an experienced foster for China, a home with no other dogs or cats.  If you would like to foster China please email rhdrdogs@gmail.com to find out more about her.

He, his 10 siblings and mother were saved by a wonderful rescue lady in China and together we are working on getting them all to the safety of GaDaH-CHINA in Sebec, Maine. We pay to get these dogs vetted, tested, quarantined and all other requirements to import them to the safety of the rescue in Sebec, Maine. The adoption fee's vary slightly depending on the weight and size of the dogs. DA-HUI adoption fee is US $550 and covers the costs we incur to save these precious souls.DA-HUI has been through the export and import quarantine requirements from China to the US. He has his rabies, core vaccines/lepto, heartworm, tick-disease and screw worm tested negative. He has been de-wormed, micro chipped and received any necessary monthly preventatives. He has an estimated date of birth of 2 January 2018 and he weighs around 19.6 pounds. His mother we believe is a Belgian Shepherd and so he is most likely a Belgian Shepherd Dog Mix, we have no idea what breed the father is. It is up to you to look at him and decide what breed you think he could be. He arrived in the United States on 23rd August 2018, landing at JFK and then was driven up to the rescue in Sebec, Maine. We are looking for families with knowledge of experience of working breed needs to ensure they get a good balance of mental and physical exercise.DA-HUI is a cautious boy, but once he has gained trust and feels safe he is very affectionate and loving. He likes to climb on your knee, or snuggle up on the bed, but has always been with his siblings. He will need time to get used to new people and new places, but once trust has been gained he is a great all round boy.WE DO NOT HAVE CATS OR LIVESTOCK AT THE RESCUE SO ARE UNABLE TO COMMENT ON HOW HE WILL ACT NEAR OR AROUND THEM.He does use the dog door to get in and out and does go outside to do his business. I do not know if he would let you know he needs to go out since he has 24/7 access to the outside, but he is extremely smart and do not think it would take long to learn, so a few initial accidents in his new home whilst he adjusts and gets used to his new routine and has his family teach him to let them know he wants to go outside should be expected. Until arriving at GaDaH, he had never been an inside dog.He would benefit from a family who understands the importance of mental stimulation as well as physical exercise. As with all rescue's he needs guidance and training and we recommend families go through at least the basics of training with him themselves so that boundaries, personalities and body language can be learned from each other. He rides good in the car, but has only been with his siblings, never has he been alone. He gets on good with other dogs and would benefit from the companionship in his transition, so a family with another dog would be great, however, if that is not the case, then play-dates with other dogs would be extremely beneficial for him.He needs an active family and one that will keep his mind stimulated and challenged. Lots of hikes and adventures, training tricks, or agility, dock diving or other fun, active, stimulating activities would be perfect for this boy when his confidence and trust has been gained. Although I have not seen him with children, given time and space his demeanor and personality I have no doubt that he would be great with them and I am sure they could keep each other entertained for many hours.Throughout all that this beautiful soul has been through, he has not once shown any kind of aggression.DA-HUI is available for adoption from Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue which is located in Sebec, Maine, for an adoption fee of $1,200. This fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the extensive costs of vetting, quarantine requirements, documentation, flights and such to get him from China to Sebec, Maine.We post in other states and in Canada to ensure our saved dogs get as much exposure as possible and the perfect families are found.

We pay to get these dogs vetted, tested, quarantined and all other requirements to import them to the safety of the rescue in Sebec, Maine. The adoption fee's vary slightly depending on the weight and size of the dogs. HUA-HUA adoption fee is US $550 and covers the costs we incur to save these precious souls.HUA-HUA has been through the export and import quarantine requirements from China to the US. He has his rabies, core vaccines/lepto, heartworm, tick-disease and screw worm tested negative. He has been de-wormed, micro chipped and received any necessary monthly preventatives. He has an estimated date of birth of 2 January 2018 and he weighs around 24 pounds. His mother we believe is a Belgian Shepherd and so he is most likely a Belgian Shepherd Dog Mix, we have no idea what breed the father is. It is up to you to look at him and decide what breed you think he could be. He arrived in the United States on 23rd August 2018, landing at JFK and then was driven up to the rescue in Sebec, Maine. We are looking for families with knowledge of experience of working breed needs to ensure they get a good balance of mental and physical exercise.HUA-HUA is a cautious boy, but once he has gained trust and feels safe he is very affectionate and loving. He likes to climb on your knee, or snuggle up on the bed, but has always been with his siblings. He will need time to get used to new people and new places, but once trust has been gained he is a great all round boy.WE DO NOT HAVE CATS OR LIVESTOCK AT THE RESCUE SO ARE UNABLE TO COMMENT ON HOW HE WILL ACT NEAR OR AROUND THEM.He does use the dog door to get in and out and does go outside to do his business. I do not know if he would let you know he needs to go out since he has 24/7 access to the outside, but he is extremely smart and do not think it would take long to learn, so a few initial accidents in his new home whilst he adjusts and gets used to his new routine and has his family teach him to let them know he wants to go outside should be expected. Until arriving at GaDaH, he had never been an inside dog.He would benefit from a family who understands the importance of mental stimulation as well as physical exercise. As with all rescue's he needs guidance and training and we recommend families go through at least the basics of training with him themselves so that boundaries, personalities and body language can be learned from each other. He rides good in the car, but has only been with his siblings, never has he been alone. He gets on good with other dogs and would benefit from the companionship in his transition, so a family with another dog would be great, however, if that is not the case, then play-dates with other dogs would be extremely beneficial for him.He needs an active family and one that will keep his mind stimulated and challenged. Lots of hikes and adventures, training tricks, or agility, dock diving or other fun, active, stimulating activities would be perfect for this boy when his confidence and trust has been gained. Although I have not seen him with children, given time and space his demeanor and personality I have no doubt that he would be great with them and I am sure they could keep each other entertained for many hours.Throughout all that this beautiful soul has been through, he has not once shown any kind of aggression.HUA-HUA is available for adoption from Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue which is located in Sebec, Maine, for an adoption fee of $1,200. This fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the extensive costs of vetting, quarantine requirements, documentation, flights and such to get him from China to Sebec, Maine.We post in other states and in Canada to ensure our saved dogs get as much exposure as possible and the perfect families are found.

Saved from the dog meat trade in China, she has come a long way since arriving in MN. This one-eyed cutie LOVES to lay on the window sill and look out at the world. We have a storage bench against a window with dog stairs leading up to it so that is her spot to hang out. (She needs dog stairs to get up on the couch, bed, etc.) This is her absolute favorite thing to do, lay on her sill.Tilly gets free reign with our other dogs during the work day. She doesn't have accidents and is happy to lay in her spot at the window. She will bark if a delivery person brings something to our door or sees someone outside. She sleeps in her kennel next to our bed at night with the door open so she can come and go. She loves having her little den to snuggle in. She doesn't need to be kenneled, but since she likes it for sleeping we have one for her, but we never close the door. She has recently started sleeping in our bed with us some nights.Tilly is tolerant of other dogs her size that are calm and don't necessarily need a play buddy. She is scared of big dogs and will growl/bark at them. Recently she has become a bit more comfortable with our lab, but she would do best as an only dog or with another small dog who is respectful of her personal space. She will occasionally try to play with our small dog and is sometimes happy to sit by our large dog, but other times growls and snaps at him. Tilly's main love in life is her people. It took her about 3 weeks to get totally comfortable with us, but now she gets so excited when we get home, wants to cuddle, and loves giving kisses. She needs some time to warm up, but then she has so much love and affection to offer.Tilly is a long-haired dog that will require regular grooming and brushing. She's not a big fan of getting groomed (she has only experienced this once in her life!) or going to the vet yet (she's a biter in these situations), so her family will need to be understanding of this until she gets more used to being poked and prodded.Tilly had a couple accidents when she first arrived at our house, but now that she is on a schedule she is doing great. She loves to go outside. You need to keep an eye on opening the door and closing it all the way because she will try to dash out to enjoy the outdoors. She loves riding in the car too. Though she likes being outside for short periods, she's not a huge fan of walks when it's warm out. She gets hot so easily. She will lay down in the road in protest sometimes. It's pretty funny. This girl definitely loves her air conditioning.Due to missing several teeth, Tilly only eats canned dog food. However, she LOVES it and gets super excited at meal times. Even though she doesn't have that many teeth, she loves chewing on small rawhide bones and they last her a long time.Overall, she is a fluffy pup who is getting more snuggly by the day. She now enjoys being lifted onto the couch to sit on our laps and cuddle. She has also started playing with toys for the first time as well, which is so adorable to watch her try to figure it out. She's a special dog that is going to make a lucky family very happy.Tilly has a collapsing trachea which restricts her in a couple ways:-She must only use a harness (no collars connected to the leash)-She does not like hot, humid weather and her activity should be limited to short walks to go to the bathroom in the summer. She also needs air conditioning.-She coughs/hacks when she gets excited or has too much activity. Her family will need to limit over stimulation so she doesn't go into a coughing fit.-There is no treatment for this condition, you just have to manage it. Basically she is more of a couch potato dog and is not up for lots of exercise. She still enjoys walks in appropriate weather, playing with toys, and gets excited for treats.",

You’d never guess what I have experienced if you weren’t told. My foster mom and dad say I’m a happy go lucky little guy who loves nothing more than laying on a Serta orthopedic dog bed. They say I have a happy little tail wag and a huge smile.I adored the snow that was here when I arrived, and I'm bummed out that it's gone. I do enjoy the beautiful weather here, but I can get warm easily because I have a thick coat. I've learned how to play with other dogs since I've arrived, but play has to be on my terms. Sometimes I like to initiate the play and other times I'll join in. My foster mom and dad love watching me play. They say I butt bump the Cairn Terriers that I live with. I have even learned to play like them and spar up on my hind legs with the youngest one. My foster mom and dad always supervise the play to make sure the others are careful around my one eye that I have left.I'm not a food motivated guy. In fact, my mom says I'm kind of a picky eater, but hey, I know what I like. I have a favorite brand of food, and I'll hold out for it until I get it. I do have favorite treats though! Hot dogs, cheese, and Reddi Whip are my favorites! I can be doing my thing around the house, but if I hear the fridge open I'll be next to you before you know it.I'm mostly potty trained, especially if I'm taken out on a schedule. My foster parents make me wear a belly band because I have a tendency to lift my leg to mark my territory. They think I may need to wear it for quite awhile, potentially the rest of my life. I think they are pretty stylish though, and I stand still to let my foster mom put them on me. Pads to line them will be a requirement. I go through a bag about every month and a half or two.I'm gonna turn it over to my foster mom now to tell you a little bit more about me.Hi, Ray Ray's foster mom here. Ray Ray is a sweetheart who has decided that the good life means living life on his terms. He is not a cuddly little lap dog. He likes people, but he likes attention on his terms. For him that can mean walking over to you and brushing up against your legs asking for some pets. Other times it can mean that he wants to be near you just keeping his eye on you.Ray Ray is a long-haired dog who will require regular grooming and combing. He doesn't seem to mind it too much. He is definitely a dog who sheds so if you are lucky enough to add this gem to your family, you will definitely become best friends with your vacuum cleaner!Ray Ray may not look like he'd be fast and agile, but he is! Due to this, he we consider him to be a flight risk. If he even thinks we are headed to the door to go somewhere, he's down our stairs and by the door before we're even ready to open it! We only exit our house through our garage because of this. That way, if he gets out the first door he's still in the garage and not chasing a bird or a bunny.Ray Ray is food and treat possessive. He has nipped at both my husband and me on a few occasions, but he has never broken skin. These nips seemed to be warnings, and we listened. This is also one of the reasons that we feel Ray Ray would be best in a home with older, respectful children or no children.Ray Ray also has front legs that rotate out even when he's standing still. The SHH vet told us there is no surgical treatment for this condition. Ray Ray has never known anything else so he just deals with it. The two vets we've seen with him have both said that he will be VERY likely to develop severe arthritis as he ages. He does receive a supplement to support his joint health. He will need a family who is prepared to support and treat this probable condition. This is also another reason we Ray Ray would do best in a home with older, respectful children or no children.Despite Ray Ray's quirks that we've mentioned, we adore the little man and are jealous of the lucky people who will be his forever family. Could that be you?",

It was apparent this dog had been tied out and had broken loose. The family took the dog to the shelter to give the owners a chance to claim her. No one came for her.The family called the shelter everyday to check on her. When it became clear that no one was coming to claim the dog, they asked PFPO to accept her into the foster program. The family called the dog Shiloh.From the moment Shiloh came to live with her foster family, they knew that she was a sweet and special girl. Shiloh was only about 8 months old and full of energy! Shiloh loved to go on walks, play in the snow, and take catnaps in the sun. Shiloh loved people, but she didn’t understand other dogs. So, Shiloh’s foster family worked very hard to find her the perfect home and perfect family to love her and her quirks.Just 6 weeks after she entered her foster family’s home, Shiloh had an adoption application from a nice retired man who lived in Delaware. After several visits and overnight stays (including an “accident” on the carpet during her first meeting and eating a loaf of bread off the kitchen counter), Shiloh’s foster family knew that this was Shiloh’s perfect forever family. But, sometimes in life, sad things happen to good dogs.Shiloh lived with this nice old man for 5 years until he got sick and passed away. Suddenly, Shiloh was without her perfect family. Staying true to the rescue’s promise of always taking back its own, Shiloh is now back with PFPO. She is still sweet. She is still loves adult people (and kids over 10). And, she still doesn’t understand other dogs. She needs a new perfect family to love her. Could that be you?Shiloh's adoption fee is $100. She is spayed UTD on vaccines, micro-chipped, heartworm negative and on heartworm/flea/tick prevention.***WE DO NOT DO OUT OF STATE ADOPTIONS***If you would like to learn more information about me, or to even adopt me please contact Peace for Paws Ohio at: adopt@peaceforpawsohio.org.Because we will not do on-the-spot adoptions, we ask that you fill out an adoption application prior to inquiring about meeting any of our pets.

Aziza is an Egyptian Baladi or Canaan dog who came to us all the way from the streets of Cairo, Egypt.  Her right, rear leg was either deliberately hacked off or she lost it in an accident.  But, missing one of her legs doesn’t seem to bother Aziza in the least.  She was pregnant, delivered her babies and was the perfect, loving Mama!  But now it’s Aziza’s turn to have a loving home of her very own.  Aziza seems to like being the only dog, but in my home, she’s just one of so many others.  However, this also tells me that she certainly can be with other dogs.  I just feel Aziza would be happiest with an older, retired couple or person.

He was badly injured when he was hit by a car as a puppy and left on the street to die. No one stopped for him and took care of him until someone from ESMA - Egyptian Society for Mercy to Animals - ; saw him. His concussion was so bad that he was unable to walk for a long time. He still has a funny walk but it does not bother him on bit. He also has trouble seeing since his eyesight was damaged too. He needs guidance with stairs, so a house with lots and long stairs would not be good for him. For the fact that his eyesight is limited he does get around very well with no assistance. HE IS NOT A DOG THAT WILL WALK ON A LEASH - HE NEEDS A YARD.He is a funny little guy with a lot of spark and lots of live in him. He would do best with one more dog or alone. He loves human attention and if you are looking for a dog to hang out with he would be it.....Dogs and cats that get hit by cars in Cairo, Egypt get no help at all. No one will stop and check on them or bring them to the vet. They lay on or in the street until the are dead.

Additionally, the adopter of Chop should recognize that Chop is partially blind due to retinal atrophy and can become spooked if he can't see someone walking towards him. Usually calling his name and talking to him does the trick. Once he hears his name and your voice he will look for you. Once he finds you, watch out!

These stunning dogs attract a wide array of adopters ranging from extremely savvy, to those novices bewitched with his or her \""wolf-like\"" appearance. We believe wholeheartedly that a Husky, regardless of individual temperment, requires dog handling ability that is well above average. Time and time again, we have known Huskies who have foiled the best laid intentions of their novice adopters.At the age of four, Lily is a formidable presence. She is a Husky mix (possibly part German Shepherd), and weighs in at a very solid 60 pounds. She is tall and leggy, and extremely athletic. While Lily has a generally friendly demeanor and seems to enjoy the attentions of strangers, she also has a very well entrenched Alpha Diva vibe, and requires some serious handling chops and command presence in an adopter. Lily would be the ideal companion for very serious Husky folks, who are comfortable establishing rules and boundaries with Huskies, or other large breeds, so that Lily knows exactly where she stands. A loosey-goosey home structure will allow her to assert herself in ways that are not optimal for a human-canine living arrangement! The key to success with Lily is a sufficient amount of exercise, and ongoing obedience training to maintain leadership. She is a high-energy dog who needs a couple brisk leash walks each day and, preferably, an active outdoor lifestyle, with a Husky savvy single or couple. She would be the ideal running or walking companion, and would love to accompany her adopters on hiking or camping adventures. She loves the outdoors, and needs to be in a active home, in which she can be integrated into a lifestyle, not relegated to a backyard.Lily would be best-suited to an only dog environment, or perhaps with one other compatible male. While Lily can be bossy and demanding in the Dog Pack, we certainly wouldn't rule out the right dog chemistry, but we would have to test this carefully at adoption. She seems to have some buddies in her canine playgroup, but then also seems to bully some dogs of lesser stature. We don't think that she would be suitable for a home with cats or small children. Lily has decent house manners, that will continue to improve under her adopter's patient, knowledgeable leadership. She is house trained and crate trained, although adopters should expect an accident or two during her transition to a new home. Lily is in excellent health, and has been spayed, and is up to date on routine shots and has tested negative for heartworm and tick borne disease. If you are interested in Lily, please call or text Denise at 860-908-9738, or email Denise@eskiesonline.com for an adoption application.About us: We are an active multi-breed dog rescue local to New England, situated in Canterbury, Connecticut.

She is a super-smart and sociable dog that thrives off the attention of her human friends. Wednesday is just as amiable with her dog friends, although sometimes she can come on a bit strong (she's just trying to hang). With her energy and activity level, we can see Wednesday doing incredible in a home with older kids that can take her on long walks or runs or a game of fetch in the yard. When left to her own devices, Wednesday is a master at puzzle toys and wobblers and can figure out where the treats are faster than you can put them in.

I've been respectful of the children that I've been around so far and I also didn't mind being around a kitty cat before I came to hang out with my foster family. I'm working on remembering to ask to go outside when I have to potty, but my foster mom says I'm nearly fully house trained - go me! I also really enjoy my crate and will go in on my own if it is open. I also love going on walks and am told I walk very nicely for such a young puppy... man, I'm really a super star, huh?! Oh yeah, I also love to give kisses and snuggle up for cuddles! Clearly I am the perfect package - already spayed, up to date on vaccinations, and micro-chipped what else could you ask for!?

My name is London and I’m a new arrival to Providence Animal Center. I am approximately 2 years old and weigh around 60lbs. I can’t wait to move from here into my new forever home.This special girl arrived to Providence Animal Center from a shelter in Florida. There she was rescued from a homeless animal camp and sent to foster because she was pregnant – she gave birth to 12 puppies & unfortunately lost them all. She is ready and deserving of a good life. Although she has been homeless for awhile, it is clear that she lived in a home before. She loves her comfy bed and has the BEST ears around!When London first arrived at our center, she was very sad, mourning the loss of her puppies. After some TLC, London is feeling more like herself. She LOVES toys and tennis balls. In fact, she likes to organize them! London's foster family reports that she is house-trained and crate-trained!London is an all around amazing dog who we feel could live with kids, dog friendly cats and she would love a doggy roommate! She's the package deal - already spayed, up to date on vaccinations, and micro-chipped. While awaiting her perfect forever home, London is spending some time in the comfort of one of our foster homes.

These girls have been through a lot together and we would like them to live their lives out together in the perfect home. Crissy and Molly lived with one owner most of their adult lives. He passed away roughly 8 months ago and a family friend agreed to take the two girls to avoid them being sent to the shelter. Their previous owner lived in Florida so the girls were transported from Florida to Kentucky to settle in with the family friend. Unfortunately, just as these girls were settling and really starting to get comfortable again the new owner accepted a new position  with her job and was transferred to Texas and did not plan to take the two senior girls with her so they were surrendered to our facility. These girls are very easy going, Molly is very sweet and happy to see everyone, Crissy can be a bit shy at first but will quickly approach for attention, Crissy just isn't as excitable as Molly. Both are very mild mannered and are fine with other animals. As far as we know they are housebroke, Molly had a lipoma (fatty growth) removed from her leg when she was spayed but there is no need for any additional treatment. Crissy had a large wart taken off her ear when she was spayed but again, there is no need for additional treatment.

Usually they are hairless but having hair is not a desirable trait in the breeding world and we rescued six of them from a Breeder in Florida when her building was destroyed in a hurricane.  They were extremely feral when rescued as they only were ever handled by one person if at all.  We had them for many months now working on handling and walking on a leash.  Coyotl is about 6 yrs old and 18lbs and is the tallest of the ones we have.  He is also the shyest with handling.  All are sweet once you get them to relax in your lap.  Coyotl needs a secure fenced yard and a dedicated loving patient owner to bring out his best personality.  He’s absolutely gorgeous and is good with dogs and cats but doesn’t really play with them.

She is up to date on vaccines, has been altered, and does well with people. Savannah does not do well with groups of dogs, and does not do well with any dog when she is in her kennel (crated). She has escaped her kennel at the vet when other dogs were around, and its recommended that she not be crated so that she does not injure herself while trying to escape the crate. She seems to be okay on leash when there is one other dog around. She will need a family who is experienced with slow introductions, and where she will not need to be crated.

Spayed. Microchipped.Where I come from people are very unkind to my breed and I was very close to not making it out alive. I was born in Egypt where baladis are considered trash & many people there go out of their way to hurt us. I was born with a hem vertebra and as a very young puppy; a very traumatic injury took away my ability to walk. Some awful individual shot me, rendering me paralyzed. As if that wasnt cruel enough, I was then tossed into a cemetery where I was left to die. Thankfully, not everyone in Egypt is cruel. I was noticed by a person visiting a loved one at the cemetery & was brought to a local rescue for medical care. I however was one of the lucky ones. After seeing pictures of how hurt I was, SNARR took me and flew me to the USA to get medical treatment. That was in June 2015. The bullet was removed from my spine and because of the extent of my injuries, my back legs needed to be removed. Today, I am a new dog. Even though I dont have any legs, I can cruise around the house just as fast as my four legged siblings. My foster mom has tried to keep diapers on me, but I dont like them so Im not wearing them. I finally trained her, so she just expresses me now & lets me be a naked baby. I love playtime with my other siblings, playing dress up for the holidays, snuggling with my foster mom and racing around the house like a maniac. There are some things though that make me nervous. Children can be too rambunctious and fast, men can be too big and their voice scares me. My wheelchair? I hate it and would rather be on the ground moving myself. Ive never been around a cat before so Im not sure how I would do with them; I guess they do have the luxury of being able to jump if they want to get away from me though. My ideal home would be with a woman or if there happens to be a man with a soft manner and a ton of patience.*Transport can be arranged to any approved adopter within the US at no additional charge.Currently Selima is located in Lawrenceville, Georgia.Please visit SNARRANIMALRESCUE.org to fill out an adoption application and our adoption requirements/process can also be found there!",

Nellie was found as a stray without a microchip and her owners never came for her. Nellie is such a smart, sweet girl! She's fun, active, seems to be good with other dogs. She is crate trained, knows sit and down, and a few tricks. We're working on stay and recall. It's recommended Nellie goes to an active family, especially if they like hiking, jogging and the like. Nellie is a big time snuggle bug and needs a family who will allow her in their bed and furniture. Her favorite spot is the back of the couch like a cat!Nellie can be a bit timid in new situations but does great with reassurance. She's terrified of storms and will need someone understanding who can coach her through them. Nellie is also a bit of an escape artists and often tests her foster's fence. She'll need a home with a fully secure yard or someone who will take her out for lots of walks and exercise.Nellie is being fostered in Maryland. ~~Husky Education And Rescue Team is a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in our foster homes all up and down the east coast. We do not have a facility in which you can visit. We find this a huge benefit because we learn our dogs and are able to educate our adopters on what it’s like to have them live in your home. Part of our process, once pre-approved, is to speak with the foster for the dog you’re interested in. If you’re still interested in adopting from our rescue the first step is to complete our adoption application online at www.huskyrescueteam.org/applyIf you have additional questions please email info@huskyrescueteam.org",

I'm a 9-month-old, exceptionally handsome Pointer pup who just moved from Georgia to North Carolina. I grew up outside on plantation, and before I moved in with my foster family, I had never been on walks, played with toys or even seen stairs. But it didn't take me long to adjust to this new, comfy lifestyle, and I'm learning new things every day. I now know how to sit, come when I’m called (usually), and my leash manners are improving. I can go up and down stairs, and I even have a few favorite squeaky toys. Technically I borrowed/stole them from my roommate, Toby. He’s teaching me how to share. I love frisking and frolicking with dogs of all shapes and sizes at the dog park. My roommate, Toby, a 12 lb Dachshund, is my favorite playmate. Cuddling with mom and dad on the couch after a long romp at the park is one of my favorite things. A big backyard to play in would be a dream come true for me in my furever home!I do drink a lot of water and have to go #1 every few hours; I'm a puppy with a small, shy bladder. And although I don’t love my crate—there are too many fun and interesting things to do in the house—I know sometimes it is the safest place for me, and I am very good and quiet when I am in there.I'm a super friendly and sometimes get excited and want to jump on you. Remember, I’m an exuberant puppy! So probably no small children in my furever family.During my recent vet appt, Dr. told me that I weigh 47lbs and its ok to gain and another3-5 lbs (yes! more snacks please!!). Other than that, I’m a perfectly healthy canine citizen!So, which lucky family would like to be my forever home? Interested in fostering?

Shasha is a nervous girl who uses her bark to intimidate new people, but don't let her fool you, she loves snuggling and butt scratches. She doesn't show well in her kennel, but when she meets new people outside she tends to warm up quickly. This girl LOVES her snacks- give her just a few treats and she will open up; she is super affectionate, playful, and cuddly!  Shasha would benefit from continued basic obedience, and impulse control training to help her to solidify basic commands and strengthen her bond with her people. We think because of her size, and her wariness of new people that she would blossom to her fullest potential in an adult only home. Kids are small, loud and move fast, and that can be very overwhelming for a shy girl like Shasha.  We would recommend a meet & greet with any potential dog housemates before sending Shasha home. Shasha is not confident with cats and would likely prefer to live without them. If you are looking for an older girl that would love to enjoy Netflix and snacks with you all day, this is your lady. Patience, treats, and lots and lots of love will make her one very happy dog!  Please give us a call at 449-1366.This animal’s adoption fee is $0 because they need a very special home!

This girl is an 8-year-old Labrador Retriever/ Pit Bull Terrier mix. She is fully grown at 70 pounds. Tara is from Helping Hands Humane Society, a no-kill shelter in Crawfordville, Georgia. Because the adoptions there are so very rare, HFGDR has partnered with them to help get Tara adopted! Before being saved by HHHS, Tara had 3 different owners, who all treated her horribly. Her first owner wanted to train her as a fighting dog. Because she's too friendly, he tried abusing her to get her to fight. Nonetheless, she was still too friendly despite the horrid abuse she endured. Tara's 2nd owner used her for breeding in hopes of making a profit, and her 3rd owner kept her chained with no food, shelter, or water. HHHS convinced the 3rd owner to surrender her, so she could have a chance of living a life with a family to call her own. Tara was quite shut down when she got to the shelter, and understandably so. She was aloof and self-contained, as she had learned that people were not to be trusted. She was never aggressive or even defensive, she was just stoic. It took some time but she learned that good people do exist, and began to show how wonderful and loving she is. Tara now seeks attention, she plays…her whole personality is lighter and happier. She has been through so much bad and has patiently waited to find a home to shower her with love and affection. This sweet girl truly deserves to be spoiled and treated like a princess.

He seems to greet his human friends with a smile, and they can’t help but smile back when they see that happy face. Hogan is a black lab/retriever mix around 3 years old that weighs about 45 lbs. He came to us from one of the worst animal shelters in the rural mountains of Georgia. A rescue person saw his picture, went to meet him there, and decided this boy needed to be saved.Hogan’s very favorite thing to do is PLAY! Perhaps that’s because he came from a place where he sat alone in a run with nothing to do all day. :( But whether it be Fetch or tug of war, Hogan loves his toys! He’s also been going to Agility with a volunteer friend and he does great on the course! He’ll even swim when given the chance! Hogan is a smart boy and knows some basic commands like sit, stay, drop and down. He is housebroken, crate trained, and good with most dogs.Unfortunately, Hogan was recently returned after being adopted for about 8 months because he became very protective of his home. Hogan needs a strong owner who has experience with protective/territorial dogs. Although he was very loving with his family, we feel that Hogan would do best in a home with no children because of his protectiveness. Hogan does get along with other dogs but has gotten into a few scuffles at doggie day camp.If you’d like to meet Hogan for yourself, just fill out an application at www.ehrdogs.org and be sure to mention his name!!

She knows the commands of sit, stay, and lay down and walks nicely on a leash.Margo came from a high kill shelter in Georgia where.her time was almost up.  She is a high energy dog who loves to play and run around in the yard with the other dogs.  She is wonderful with people or dogs.  We don't know how she is with cats.  She has shown no aggression since coming here and only seems to have a loving, sweet nature for anyone who comes her way.  We think she would be fine with older children but because of her energy level may accidentally knock young children down.  Margo loves to play with her toys, including balls, tugs and hard bones; which she loves to bite on.  Because Margo is a high energy dog a fenced yard would be a must so she would be able to run around and be safe and secure.

She enjoys the company of other dogs and loves to play together with them in  the yard.  A fenced yard is a must for this dog so she would be able to run free and safely.  Layla is a high energy dog who loves to play with human or dog.If u think she might be a match for your family, please email Save Us Dog Rescue at fries3@aol.com or call Judi at (908) 510-8721.",

Poppy is a delightfully friendly girl, about 2-3 years of age, who was found as a stray in GA and ended up in a shelter.  Poppy was overfed in her former life, and is on a weight loss program in foster care.   Her adopter will need to be fully committed to continuing this until she reaches a healthy weight.  She’s already gone from becoming out of breath on a five minute walk, to walking a little over a mile twice daily at a brisk pace.  With continued portion control and a slowly increasing level of exercise, she’ll regain a trim figure.  This will potentially take several months, but you’ll be rewarded with a wonderful lifelong companion.  She currently weighs 55 lbs. but her eventual  weight should be closer to 35-40 lbs..Poppy is the friendliest cattle dog I’ve met.  She loves everyone and wants nothing more than to greet everyone she sees.  She walks beautifully on leash on a flat collar or harness, and exhibits no reactivity towards other dogs, cars, etc. encountered on walks.   Poppy tested well at the shelter with both small and large male and female dogs.   She currently lives with two older foster cattle dog sisters, and gets along fine with them.  Poppy does have a tendency to resource guard her person from other dogs in the home, but is easily redirected.  Her adopter will need to understand how to work through that should they have other dogs.  She would do best with a laid back or more submissive canine sibling, such as those in her foster home.   She would also be fine as an only dog.Training will be a breeze with this smart girl.   She’s food motivated and takes treats gently.   Poppy is a medium energy girl, but I suspect that as she trims down her energy level will increase.    She does settle  down well in the home as long as her exercise needs are met.   Poppy is spayed, housebroken, crate trained, and rides well in the car.  She can be left loose in the home without fear of her chewing or otherwise destroying property.  She has no separation anxiety and rarely barks.    She is microchipped, heartworm and Lyme negative, and is on heartworm and flea/tick preventatives, as well as being current on vaccinations.Poppy did not test well with cats at the shelter, and I’ve observed a strong prey drive towards cats in the neighborhood as well as wildlife, so she should go to a home without cats or other small pets.  Poppy hasn’t been tested with children, although she’s exhibited her normal happy attitude when passing by kids.  Because she does get excited and sometimes mouthy, she could potentially knock a young child over, therefore, older dog-savvy children only.  Poppy is a confident, well adjusted dog, who will make a devoted companion.  If you’re patient and willing to work on her weight issue, she could be the dog for you.   An active home is a must for this girl. Questions?  Poppy is located in South Williamsport, PA.

Being an older girl she needs more frequent potty breaks. She does fine with her foster dog siblings but is totally fine with being the only one.

Her favorite time of day is breakfast and dinner and anything in between involving food! She will wiggle her little tail and looks like she is smiling because she is so excited. Dizzy does have food allergies but we were able to find both canned and dry food and treats that are inexpensive and won't bother her.

Mia has quite a rescue story her mom, Furry, was living on the streets of New Delhi with Mia and her three siblings when they were very young, but their mother was unable to feed them due to illness. Mom and pups were taken into Kannan Animal Welfare, a rescue group in New Delhi, and brought back to health. Furry has already been adopted here in the US, and now Mia is the first of her siblings to come in search of a home! Because Mia grew up in a rescue facility, life in a home is very new for her. That being said, theres plenty about it she loves! Walks, couches, grassy open spaces, and toys (even sticks will do!), have all been big hits. When Mia is comfortable she is a funny, happy, and athletic girl whos happy to spend a few minutes wrestling or racing with the other Desi dog in her foster home, and then a few more minutes snuggling with her foster mom. Mia thrives on routine and attaches very deeply to her household members. Although she would benefit from ongoing exposure to new situations and people, she would probably be happiest in a low-key household with one or two people, who can help her develop a sense of security and confidence. Those people will find in Mia a dog who is endlessly entertaining, unbelievably charming, and absolutely devoted!

Information on the Indian Native Dog breed:IN (Indian Native), Desi (Local) or Pariah Dog is a pure, ancient, indigenous dog of India that abounds the Indian streets. A long time ago, thousands of years before the arrival of modern pure breeds, a race of dogs much like this one inhabited the Indian subcontinent. These were the very first domesticated dogs and Man's earliest animal companions. It has evolved entirely through natural selection without human intervention of any kind resulting into a very hardy, extremely intelligent, alert and independent thinking dog.This is a natural breed of dog that is pure in a true sense and how nature intended a dog to be; hence they are way superior to the artificially developed man made breeds that we call pure breeds today. Its origin dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years – older than any other breed. This is a natural primitive breed which is a direct descendant of the early domesticated dogs. These dogs are found to be genetically healthy with no known genetic diseases and a very strong immune system. They are perfectly adapted for survival; a free-roaming life on the street for these dogs is always difficult and often hostile and hence requires high order of intelligence, quick and independent thinking to survive. On the streets it is the survival of the fittest, usually out of a litter some will get run over by cars while others will succumb to hunger and malnutrition. Only the most hardiest and intelligent ones will survive to produce off springs. When this survivor is adopted as a Pet, their owners are often awe struck with their beauty, grace, intelligence, loyalty and hardiness.They are highly adaptable, quick learners and versatile and are known to be even smarter and definitely calmer than the intelligent Border Collies. They are very agile and excel at many dog sports such as agility and also make great jogging/running companions and can be even faster than Grey Hounds. While active outdoors, they are usually very calm and quiet indoors. They have tremendous stamina and hence need an active family who will take them for a daily brisk walks or a run.IN Dogs are sensitive by nature and do not respond well to harsh training methods and hence need an even tempered, gentle but firm and loving owner who knows how to calmly and consistently communicate the rules of the house.These dogs love children and are known to have a calm and gentle demeanor around them. They bond strongly with their people and make an excellent family pet that is very loving, loyal and intelligent. These dogs do not bark much but are always alert; they are friendly yet wary of strangers and make good watch dogs.IN Dogs are low maintenance dog as they are generally very healthy and like to stay clean; they hardly shed and have virtually no doggy odor. Their smooth, fine short hair coat is easy to groom. They have an all-weather coat that allows them to easily adapt to different weather conditions.A well-looked after pet IN dog will rarely need to see a vet and may live a healthy life of up to the age of 12 – 18 years.This is a medium size dog with an average height of 20-25 inches (51-64 cms) at the shoulder and generally weigh about 28-55 pounds (12 – 22 kgs).They are found in all colors and variation with erect or floppy ears; however, a typical IN Dog usually will have erect ears, a wedge-shaped head and a tail that curls over its back. Most IN Dogs are similar in appearance to other prehistoric dogs like the Australian Dingos.In the last few years, we have successfully rescued, rehabilitated and found homes over 500 pariah dogs throughout the Northeast United States and the West Coast.Please visit our Face book page to see the IN dogs adopted through our rescue.http://www.facebook.com/RescueWithoutBorders",

Lucy was a little puppy and probably got separated from her pack and immediately got attached to this human who saved her. Since she was so sweet and trusting little pup he decided to foster her until a good home would be found. Sadly the street dogs have little to no chance at finding someone to adopt locally in India so our rescue was contacted to find sweet Lucy loving home in the U.S. Lucy is a happy, loving, outgoing dog who is social and greets everyone with a wagging tail. She loves to go on long walks and run/play with her other dog friends or children in a fenced yard. She is crate and leash trained and fully house broken. Lucy is 2 years old. She is a fully vaccinated, has a blood and stool test report and an International health certificate. She is also spayed and microchiped.  If you have it in your heart to give this sweet dog a chance of having a good life please email Rescuewithoutborders@gmail.com for an adoption application. Information on the Indian Native Dog breed:IN (Indian Native), Desi (Local) or Pariah Dog is a pure, ancient, indigenous dog of India that abounds the Indian streets. A long time ago, thousands of years before the arrival of modern pure breeds, a race of dogs much like this one inhabited the Indian subcontinent. These were the very first domesticated dogs and Man's earliest animal companions. It has evolved entirely through natural selection without human intervention of any kind resulting into a very hardy, extremely intelligent, alert and independent thinking dog.This is a natural breed of dog that is pure in a true sense and how nature intended a dog to be; hence they are way superior to the artificially developed man made breeds that we call pure breeds today. Its origin dates back 12,000 to 15,000 years – older than any other breed. This is a natural primitive breed which is a direct descendant of the early domesticated dogs. These dogs are found to be genetically healthy with no known genetic diseases and a very strong immune system. They are perfectly adapted for survival; a free-roaming life on the street for these dogs is always difficult and often hostile and hence requires high order of intelligence, quick and independent thinking to survive. On the streets it is the survival of the fittest, usually out of a litter some will get run over by cars while others will succumb to hunger and malnutrition. Only the most hardiest and intelligent ones will survive to produce off springs. When this survivor is adopted as a Pet, their owners are often awe struck with their beauty, grace, intelligence, loyalty and hardiness.They are highly adaptable, quick learners and versatile and are known to be even smarter and definitely calmer than the intelligent Border Collies. They are very agile and excel at many dog sports such as agility and also make great jogging/running companions and can be even faster than Grey Hounds. While active outdoors, they are usually very calm and quiet indoors.

And yet she survived scrounging and competing for food with other street dogs. This wonderful organization took her in, gave her medical help, and sent her to us! We feel blessed to be able to help Hazel and give her a better chance at life.  She is a shy and sweet pup who everyday gives us back more love and affection than we can imagine.  She has the most beautiful blue eyes that just speak to you! We are looking for a special forever home for Hazel where she can blossom and become everything we know she can be.

Rescued from a high kill shelter in Indiana, we took in Chance, hoping that he would receive his second CHANCE at life.  Chance was adopted to what he thought would be his forever home.  Sadly, Chance’s owner learned that he is in the early stages of kidney disease and he was not willing to provide the care that Chance would need.  He was returned to us and is searching, yet again, for his CHANCE at a forever home.  Despite having a kidney condition, the care that he will require is quite simple.  Chance will need to be on daily antacids and senior dog food.  Although he is nowhere close to a senior, the food has less proteins for his kidneys to process.  Chance is around four years old and, as you can see, absolutely gorgeous!  Chance is a smaller lab mix, weighing around 55 pounds.  This makes him just the right size for a family who doesn’t want to be plowed into all the time.  (No offense, huge lab lovers!).  Chance can be a little shy at first but he warms up quickly and LOVES people.  Chance is great with other dogs and always plays nicely.  This poor guy has known nothing but people giving up on him.

For additional information on adopting Noah or any of the other CBBCR foster dogs, go to the CBBCR website at www.comebyebcrescue.org. Update January 18, 2016Ty and NoahThese two handsome boys are brothers and are now about 4 1/2 years of age. It isn’t required that they be adopted together but they would sure love that possibility. These boys are very sweet and affectionate boys. Ty and Noah need to be placed in a home without children.They are initially a bit suspicious of people they don’t know, Ty more so than Noah, but given a little bit of time to become familiar they are both loves. They are both good with other dogs and regularly interact with other dogs. They both love to chase along after my Border Collie when we are playing fetch.Noah likes to stalk kitties and Ty could care less about them. They both enjoy riding in the vehicle but both are nervous when they are in an unfamiliar environment. They are both good in the house but are still crated when I am not home. Their crate behavior is much better now compared to when they were youngsters but still need the opportunity to go out for potty breaks often and shouldn’t be left for more than about 4 hours at a time.Their idea of a perfect home setting would be a quiet, country setting with a large fenced yard for them to play and have fun with their people and to have at least one stay at home parent. They would be best as home bodies and to go along places for ride alongs but are not the type of dogs that will enjoy going EVERYWHERE and being around lot of “strangers” on a regular basis. If they are not adopted together they would do best in a home with another dog because they do seem to feel safer when they are in the presence of other dogs.Noah has been introduced to some agility obstacles and even though he is hesitant at first, when he is given a little time to get the obstacle figured out he seems to have fun learning how to maneuver the obstacle. These boys are looking for a patient person to provide them with a forever home. Someone who will love them for the soft, sensitive boys that they are and allow them to live in a quiet and predictable home.*******************************************Noah - This guy is a sweet boy that is typically very comfortable meeting new people when they come here for meet and greets. He likes toys but will shred soft, squeaky toys. He is foodie and enjoys learning. He did get to go to an agility open class once and very quickly found out how much fun it is to put his paws up on things ;) He is a very cuddly and affectionate guy. He does tend to have times in his crate where he salivates and has anxiety – but it is not all the time and seems to happen randomly…not because of one thing or another. He is good in the car, reasonable on leash. Good for bathing and nail trimming. I really like Noah and think he has the potential to be a nice companion level pooch for the right person. He gets a bit worried in new environments and is a soft, sensitive young guy…that also will need a patient and understanding human. (9/24/14) *******************************************************Oh, baby Noah.....he is sooooooooooooooooo cute and also a tennis ball junky! He loves, loves, loves tennis balls!!! He takes a bit longer than Spense and Jude to warm up to new people and a new evironment....he and his brother Ty are the most 'soft' of this litter born on September 16, 2013. He is a foodie puppy, and lots of ball drive, and once comfortable in his environment is such a fun boy. He very much enjoys playing with other dogs....was a barker at my kitties at first but now they are old news....he is very good in his crate...it is a rare day that he would have an accident in his crate....which again is awesome compared to how we started. I believe Noah will blossom into a wonderful companion level dog in the right home, that is patient and gentle and knows how to keep him safe and satisfied in his day to day adventures!! (3/28/14)",

He is now a sweet and cuddly boy that is very comfortable in his familiar environment. He is excellent with other dogs and fine with cats. He is typically a bit suspicious of unfamiliar people but if given a little space and time he warms up fairly quickly. Ty is a very soft and sensitive boy that is very effected by a change in his environment or routine. He is looking for a home with humans that are very patient and understanding and realize that he will need adequate time to become familiar with them and his new home….this will not happen in 1 week, or two weeks and likely not even 6 weeks. He is a wonderful doggie but wasn’t allowed to have the best start in life and had no exposure to novel stimuli and very little interactions with humans until he was rescued by CBBCR at 5 months of age.He needs a forever home where he won’t have to be crated for more than about 2-3 hours at a time…and a home that will give him plenty of opportunity to go outside for potty breaks…..or someone that would have access to a doggy daycare where he could go daily while his humans are at work away from home. (12/6/14)*******Ty is a very calm BC. One of the most, calm pups I’ve ever been around. He is an observer and likes to lay and watch what is going on and takes it all in…. He enjoys lounging in the baby pool on hot days….he LOVES squeaky toys but will shred them. He also like to have a good chew on a hard bone while he is sunning himself in the yard. He doesn’t like to chase the water hose but loves to chase other dogs while he is chasing the water hose. He is an affectionate and cuddly guy. Good for bathing and nail trimming and acts reasonable on leash. Again, a softie and is worried when out of his familiar environment. He is the biggest of his brothers but is still in the 40# range. He is a sweetie pie but is soft and will also need a very patient and understanding human in his life. When meeting new people, he is typically stand-off-ish…..but is quiet. He does not bark at people he doesn’t know and will warm up much more quickly than his brother. (9/24/14)********************************* Ty is the biggest pup of the litter and is just as sweet as he is big! Born on September 16, 2013, he is one of the softest pups of the bunch and takes a little longer to warm up to new people and new environments than his brothers...but once he does is very much a joy to be around. He also loves squeaky toys and if left to his own with them, will shred them.... He loves playing with other doggies and is good with the kitties. He is VERY foodie and will be a fun boy to train due to his intense food drive! Again, I believe he will blossom into a wonderful companion level boy in the right home, that is patient and gentle and knows how to keep him feeling safe and satified in his new adventures!!(updated 3/28/14)",

Here are some photos and videos of her interacting with other friends. Because Coco is a young dog we'd feel she'd do best in a home with no small children, maybe ages 8 and up. We also think she'd love a playmate.Coco is spayed, current on her vaccines and healthy!Coco has not yet lived with one of our fosters so we're offering a foster to adopt situation.

She brings a sweet & compassionate energy to her foster home where she has made friends over the last year. Becoming accustomed to life not on the streets has been hard for Kourtney, but she is making progress every day. A life of routine & patience is what Kourtney is looking for in her forever family. She will do best in a positive minded home with older children (teens) & a fenced in back yard to chase tennis balls in the sunshine. Kourtney's foster family says she establishes great companionship with other confident dogs which help her open up once she feels comfortable. Letting Kourtney just be a dog & not forcing her to be anything more than what she is safe with is the key to winning her trust. Kourtney is a treat & food driven hound. High value treats seem to give her enough encouragement to approach & possibly even paw for attention. She is smart, playful & entertaining to have around the house especially if you already have a dog who needs some friendship. Kourtney will attach to their hip & pick up on the daily life activities quickly.To help Kourtney with a successful transition to her home, she will require a fenced yard (she is not quite ready for walking on a leash with a new family yet), and another dog to help her continue to gain confidence. Kourtney is currently in a foster home, if you are interested in learning more about this special gal, please email adopt@baypathhumane.org. We look forward to hearing from you!",

WE ARE A NO-KILL 501-C-3 NON-PROFIT RESCUE: To see an animal, you must fill out an application first and then once approved, we can set up for you to meet the animal you are interested in.Here is the Dog Application that you can copy and paste into a browser: https://fs17.formsite.com/waverlypetrescue/form028182466/index.htmlHank was a stray and his time was up in a kill shelter in Kansas. A WPR volunteer was adopting a dog from this shelter in Kansas, and decided to take Hank too so that he would not be put down the next day. They knew Hank could be a WPR dog. They just couldn't leave him knowing he would be put down. So Hank is now a Waverly Pet Rescue dog. He is living in a foster home. He is up to date on shots, tested heartworm negative, and neutered.Hank is about 3 years old as of May 2019. We have had him for a couple of weeks now and he is doing well! He has not been around cats or children yet.5/17/19: So we picked up Hank last night.  He is such a sweet boy, but very timid.  Unsure of everything.  But, he has already made great improvements in the 24 hours we have had him.  It will just take some time to make him understand that he is in a safe place and everything is okay.  I think he will be a great dog.  He is very loving.  No aggression at all.  He is eating good too.  And getting along great with our dog.  In fact, I think it helped having our dog.  She kind of shows him the ropes sometimes.  He has done great with the kennel as well, and so far seems as though he is housebroke.5/26/19: My daughter is interning at a vet clinic this summer so she showed some pictures of Hank to another employee and they think that he is a boxer/pit bull mix.  When I googled brindle boxer pit mix I got some pictures that do look a lot like Hank.  He unofficially weighs 52 lbs.  We weighed him here at home.  Here are a few words of how I would describe Hank.  Hank is a sweet boy and loves everyone.  He's shy with new experiences but with patience he comes around.  Gets along great with other dogs.  Likes to go for walks.  Housebroke.  He goes in his kennel great at night, but not so much in the morning for the day.  He has been destructive with cushions and blankets in his kennel during the day, but outside of his kennel he's pretty good.  He really likes being around people and seems to be so happy.  He's a pretty cool dog overall.  6/18/19 UPDATE: I had him briefly around a 3 yr old child and he did fine. Was a little startled by the child’s quick movements but I think children a little older would understand better. I can play with his feet and tail and he doesn’t care. I lay on him when we snuggle and play and he loves it.  He has never shown any aggression at all. I think he would probably do just fine with the kids.  He loves attention.

I rescued her from the Lawrence Humane Society in Lawrence, Kansas where I went to school at KU. Fortunately, the humane society there fortunately saves pit bull mixes from other shelters in the area that can't hold onto the breed. Even though they didn't know her parents, she is easily identified as a pit bull mix, with a softer stature than brawny pits. Luna was 4 months old (2 1/2 yrs old now) and was the only puppy they had, let alone one of the only dogs who greeted me with a wagging tail with her head down and ears back. It was much easier to let Luna run around when I had a yard at my house near school. She loves playing with other dogs, but not cats. She is potty trained and is comfortable in her own crate, especially after having just played fetch for half an hour. She is up to date on shots, spayed, microchipped, and is regularly taking flea/tick & heartworm medication.Please consider a donation to PBRC. Your donations make a difference to countless dogs through spay/neuter, educating the public, promoting a positive image and finding them permanent homes. Donate : http://www.pbrc.net/donate.html",

HERE'S THE SCOOPEvery once in awhile, when are are able, we like to help Euth listed shelter dogs in different areas. Teejay here was on the Euthansia list for \""medical\"" At Witchita Animal Shelter - for his eye. We fell in love when we saw his picture and even more in love with him when he arrived here ?? Teejay had eye Entropion, which he had surgery for here after he arrived from Kansas. He's all healed up and he won't have anymore issues there. Absolutely no reason to end his life and we were so glad to be able to pull him off that E list.? FAMILY GOALS! To know Teejay is to love him! He's a big squishy loveug! Loves to cuddle and loves car rides. Loves to go on walks. He listen's very well! He knows sit, shake, and allllmost rollover. Lol. He has a slight 'jumping up on new people' issue, but his foster Mom, Cindi Hill, (Thanks Cindi Hill! ,) has been working diligently with him on this and his new family will need to also continue working with him on it. He gets a little exited with new people but calms down quickly. He also has a little \""talky growl\"" when meeting new people but then in about 10 SECONDS, he's your best friend.He's actually a pretty chill dog in his foster home.  ?? Older kids. If you have kids, we are looking for a home with older respectful kids, no rough housing because he can get overly amped up, which can lead to really bad unwanted behavior. Little kids, toddlers and baby's we are unsure on. We have none to test him with. He could definitely could knock a toddler over, and he has an extra long whipping tail that could bonk a little one. ? Good with dogs. We just have to find the right match. Teejay could be fine being the only dog. His love for people is stronger than love from a dog friend. He's been in his foster home with his temp brother Duke for over two weeks and has done fine. Duke is a super social, love every dog, dog park friendly dog. Duke is also laid back and kind of, shall I say, \""whatever dude\"" with other dogs. ? If you have other dogs, that personality type is what will be the best fit for Teejay. Teejay is not a dog park dog. He also gets to amped up when he see's other dogs, just because he doesn't know if they want to be friend or foe. ? No cats for Teejay.Here comes the semi complicated part.... Teejay has allergies, as many of this breed typically do. We can't keep him in foster forever until we 100% know what's going to work for him best, because it will take some trial and error to determine. We are working to determine if the allergies are environmental, food or both. And that takes some time.Right now, we are trying different things - a high quality specialty food and he's on Apoquil. Over time, we will do some tweaking to pinpoint what exactly the allergy is. Here's the plus side! We are here for our dogs for life, Always and forever. When we find his approved home (we are hoping is one that knows about allergies and this breed), we will help financially until we can figure out with the help of his new family, what's going to work best for him. We just need to find him the perfect home, and we will work alongside that family to solve his allergy issues, together! Please don't shy away from him because of this. He is such a good boy!??House trained and crate trained but he is also fine to be left free roam.??Teejay doesn't require alot of exercise but he does love his walks and a fenced yard to run around and sniff in.??A fenced yard is required. He is in a 6 foot wood fence now. If you have a short chain link sharing with neighbors with dogs, that's not going to work unless the neighboring dogs could care less about other dogs, as he would probably fence fight. ??He would do best in a quieter home with few visitors. ??New family must be able to afford vet care such as future vaccinations, heartworm/flea tick prevention and whatever else comes up  his entire life. HEALTH STATS!?Approx. 2 years old?American Bulldog Blend?68 lbs ?Neutered male?Current on Vaccines?Heart Worm Negative?On Flea/Tick/Heartworm prevention. ?Fecal Negative?Micro ChippedHOW TO ADOPT:?Stable, established homes required. ?Message the page for our simple adoption app.?An approved adoption application needed before a meet and greet.?? Two week trial home and then the adoption agreements are signed.? Teejay's adoption fee is $100.00? He is located in North Platte NE, but non local adoptions are possible.? If you would like more info, call Jessica Sprague @ 308-539-0277.If you're unable to adopt, please share so we can find the home of Teejay's dreams",

After having him 2 years, Charlie started grumbling and wanting to wrestle when picked up. The lady had a small child and was scared he would bite her.We have had him a week, he is a very loving, playful dog that just wants to be held. When you wrestle around with him he growls and fusses but that's his way of playing. We've had youth as young as 10 play with him and he just loves to be held. With not knowing the background, we would probably not recommend small children.Charlie is located in Kentucky and will have transfer up north the weekend of the 6th.If you are interested, first please fill out the online application and someone will call you to answer questions about the process.Charlie's adoption fee is $450.00 which includes transport.

I'm about 2 years old and under 15 pounds.  I'm originally from Kentucky where I lived with two other dogs until our owner couldn't afford to care for us any more.  I've been in my foster home since Jan. 2019.   As you can see from my pictures, I love to be on a lap, it  doesn't matter whose, as long as I can be close to someone.  I am really a people dog.   I have quite the personality.  I'm a lover, a snuggler, a kisser, a hoarder of toys/bones, a thief of toys/bones from the other dogs and a bit of a napoleon.  I'm not a fan of big dogs....there's that napoleon complex, or submissive dogs because I like to be the big cheese.  If another dog puts me in my place when I try to be bossy, I will typically be their friend unless toys are involved and then I'm going to steal them.  My foster mom noticed my back legs would sometimes kick out, like they slipped out of the socket.  The doctor examined me and noticed I didn't have knee sockets in my back legs.  I had a successful surgery.  I hated being confined and not being able to run and play with my fosters, but I survived the healing period and have been release by the doctor.  Since I never had the stability in my legs I was not able to jump.  Now that my legs are fixed, I can jump, but my brain doesn't know that.  If you have a cat, it must like to play and be chased.  I know there is someone out there looking for a little lovable goofball like me...I just wish they would hurry up and meet me on Sunday from 11:00 - 1:45 pm at PetsMart.",

He is so easy, sweet, low key and loving that it seems to me he would make the idea family pet. He is issue free except for not liking cats much and even gets along with small dogs. Please help me find this boy a foster or forever home. He has never had a lick of love in his life according to the shelter staff, having spent his life on the end of a chain outdoors. Then when his owners moved, the surrendered him to the kill shelter!  In the shelter environment where he is not tied up and not exposed to the outdoor elements, he is likely more content than he has ever been. So very sad. He is the EASIEST dog I have ever seen, is not needy or demanding. He is goofy and playful without being frenetic Please help me give Ranger the life he is so deserving of.

They did not want to risk anything happening to him, so they lovingly surrendered him to the rescue that I work with in KY. Red is super friendly, very loving & happy to give kisses to anyone who gets close enough. He just bubbles over with personality, but he is also a very active young man. For as tiny as he is & he is tiny -- he can jump up very high, he sails up on my large crates. It’s amazing to see how fast he can run on those tiny little legs.

Morgan is a sweet girl who needs a little extra TLC to thrive - Morgan has shown some fear reactivity to strangers in the past but has made great strides with the help of her dedicated foster and the Training and Behavior Team at AWLA, and we know she'll only improve in a loving adoptive home. As long as Morgan is allowed to meet new friends on her own terms, she warms up and becomes playful, soft, and affectionate! Morgan does very well with other dogs and thrives in playgroups - other dogs help boost her confidence, especially around strangers, when they show her that humans can be wonderful friends and are nothing to be afraid of! Morgan's foster and trainers have been working on conditioning her to use a basket muzzle as an extra precaution though Morgan is more of a \""flighter\"" than a \""fighter\"" and generally avoids people she doesn't know, so as long as she's granted sufficient space to retreat, she does very well on walks and in other situations with people she doesn't know.

What a little love-bug this baby, she just wants to sit with you & be close to you.Erica came from a shelter in Kentucky where she was dumped by her previous owner. They just dropped her & she became “unwanted” thru no fault of her.Clearly, she has German Shepherd in her, but I don’t know what else she is might she might be. She appears white in some photos, but she is several shades of a cream color with yellow trim. She is a lovely puppy.In watching her interact with her foster siblings I'm getting to see just how smart she is. They have a \""chase me game\"" where one starts -- usually Scottie -- running at top speed around the shed & make it around the whole yard several times. I just watched Erica figure out the game much faster then most. She started to chase after Scottie but noting it was unlikely to catch her --- since she is so much bigger -- I watched her DETOUR & took a short-cut & met Scottie when she came around. Usually, as they mature they learn that's the only way to catch a dog but she figured it out immediately proving just how smart she is. In my experience, GSD's are always so very smart. That is why they are used as service dogs with Police.She loves people & adores all the dogs here & just wants to run & chase around like a little nut. My guess is she could go as high as 60-65 lbs. full grown. She is doing very well with her puppy training & crate training. When she has to potty, she lets us know.If you have been looking to adopt a constant companion who will just want to be you and love to you & go everywhere you do – please consider adopting my adorable baby girl.In the best interest of our rescued puppies, we pick parents who work from home or part-time.

They call me Hal & I’m a good ole boy who hails from Kentucky. I belonged to a hunter whose love for me lasted only as long as my hunting prowess. He complained that I was bringing home nothing but “disgusting varmints”, & the next thing I knew, I was abandoned along the roadside with so many of my fellow coonhounds who were also failed hunters. Unfortunately, this is the plight of many coonhounds in the South. To tell you the truth, I was pretty fed up with hunting anyway. Hauling around those smelly old carcasses…for what???  So when I heard that Southern Transport was sending a bunch of us up to Yankee territory, I jumped at the opportunity & found myself at MLAR. With my deeply furrowed & foldy head, & my “awe shucks”, laid back personality, I immediately worked my Southern charm on the volunteers. One volunteer in particular figured out that what I do best is cuddle, & I could see that when she kissed my snoot she was in absolute heaven. And so was I! I would be fine with kids of all ages because I greet people with all 4 paws on the ground. Like most Southerners, I like to have long conversations with you, & I can be quite vocal about some issues. My beautiful sonorous bay can be heard across the meadow, so I guess I wouldn’t be suited for life in a twin or a townhouse. Just a modest home with a nice fenced yard would do as I love to amble & explore new scents. I love meeting other dogs & approach them all with a wagging tail & good spirits. But no cats, please! (Don’t even get me started on that subject!)  Oh, & my brains! When I was in the Home School Room & introduced to those puzzles in which food was hidden, I discovered that if I stood there long enough & licked the volunteer, I would get the food without having to solve the puzzle. Pretty smart, eh? My best trick is that I am unerringly housebroken. A few weeks ago, I had to be crated overnight for 12 hours. I slept quietly & kept my crate clean. Now that’s perfection! My stay at MLAR has made me realize that I was never really cut out to be a hunter, but rather a hearthside hound. So…goodbye to Dixie, goodbye to Stars & Bars. I am now a Yankee Doodle Dandy, ready to enrich your life with love, warmth, cuddling, fun & games, & just plain lazing around.If you are interested in meeting any of our adoptable dogs, please fill out an application at http://www.mlar.org/adopt/adoption-processE-mails regarding adoption are not considered an application.

Take me for a big walk every day; give me something to do. After my job’s done, I’ll curl up in front of the fire with you in the evenings.Scottie is such a great girl. She's beautiful, tall, lanky, very affectionate as you can see. She just wants to sit next to you & hold hands! She has the whole package -- loves people, loves kids & thinks cats are very interesting.Her name fits her perfectly because her patches are exactly the color of butterscotch! Now that she’s been professionally groomed --- under all the dirt from her former home in KY -- we found she has a soft, lovely shiny white.We have a professional dog trainer who comes twice a week & she works with all the dogs to teach basic training & leash manners. I’m told she is doing very well. When she is out walking in the neighborhood people remark how pretty she is & that is very true. She has also been trained to walk well on a leash so she won't drag you down the street!Winter is not my favorite season to be sure but Scottie loves it. We have numerous large water bowls out back & I when I have to break up the ice she goes crazy with joy. She runs around with her ice chunks as if they are a true treasure!Scottie is an odd combo of breeds, she seems to have some Lab, Hound & a touch of Bloodhound due to her droopy eyes but I think her primary breed is an English Coonhound.She also has a delightful personality, very playful, sweet & loves people & especially loves other dogs. She can amuse herself all day playing with all her foster siblings.There is a video below showing her playing with her favorite toy a rope. You can see she is trying to get the other dogs to engage with a good tug-of-war game but if they don't feel like it -- I've seen her just play with her ropes alone. Since ropes & tug-of-war are her favorite thing to do, hoping she can be adopted into a home with another young dog so they play together. There is also a video of her playing with one of her foster siblings Sapphire.Her legs are still gangly & she still kind of trips over them but as she matures I’m sure she’ll a very graceful young dog. She's a big girl, long, tall & lean and she should be about 60 lbs full grown.

This dog is never sad and spreads cheer everywhere he goes.Poor Dozer was hit by a car, fractured his spine in two places,and is paralyzed from the waist down.He was left with no pain meds or care on a shelter floor for two weeks. We were able to save him 30 minutes before euthanasia, and get him from KY up to our vetsin IL. We took him to the University of Illinois Vet School neurologists and it's been determined surgery is not an option. He exhibits spinal walking and can stand and walk brieflybut will always need a wheelchair or be carried to get around if outside. He does a very good job scooting around the house when out of a chair and has his own wagon as well as wheelchair. These items will go with him when he is adopted.Any potential adopters should be able to lift and carry a 50 lb dog that is likely to get 60 lbs. Dozer is currently in acupuncture and physical therapy and will need to continue to do so for several more months. He is incontinent and wears belly bands.

She’s just 2 years old (est. birthdate 4/17) and weighs a healthy 60 pounds. Aretha has travelled a long, rough road. She came to STAF from an overcrowded, high-kill county shelter in Kentucky. Upon arrival, we discovered that she had a microchip registered in Tennessee. We reached out to her family of record, who told us that they’d given her away and did not want her back. To add insult to injury (literally!) a paw injury required Aretha to spend five weeks on restricted exercise and in an e-collar. Aretha likes rubs and pets as much as the next dog, but she is happiest with vigorous exercise and hard workouts. The Catahoula in her needs a purpose in life … retrieving tennis balls, brisk walks and running are her favorites.  She also shows great potential on agility courses. If there is a doggy-version of a triathlon, we’ve no doubt Aretha would rock that, too. Sufficiently exercised, she is a undemanding, affectionate girl. Thanks to a weekly training class and special attention from The Pet Spot trainers (thank you, Eric & Lee!), Aretha has a great obedience-foundation and is happy to work for treats and praise. And speaking of praise, here’s some from Aretha’s favorite volunteer and standing Thursday-night training date: “Aretha is one of the smartest dogs I have been around. She is very trainable, and would be a great Frisbee dog. Properly presented, Aretha will accept new tasks and training very well. I keep treats in my pocket, and Aretha will paw at my pocket asking for a treat. Her vision is incredible, and she can spot people, dogs, birds at amazing distances. Aretha will bond quickly with her new family. I think in a day or two, with some play and treats and pets, she will be a great dog for an active lifestyle family.”• All of our animals are spayed/neutered and current on shots.• We do not do same-day adoptions; we ask that you return for a follow-up visit before taking an animal home.• You must be 21 years or older to adopt from STAF.• We require a 4-foot-tall physical fence for homes with children under the age of 11. We also may require a physical fence for specific dogs on a case-by-case basis, depending on each dog’s behavior and exercise needs.• Invisible fences: Due in part to increasing coyote activity/incidents in the area and the difficulty of predicting how a dog will respond to invisible fence training, we cannot adopt to homes with invisible fences unless otherwise noted in a dog’s profile.• We do request vet and personal references.• We can facilitate adoptions within a 75-mile radius of our Cincinnati-based shelter.Please visit www.STAF.org for visiting hours, a downloadable application, and additional information.",

I came from KY with my pups after not having a home to give birth in and once I was welcome into a home boy was that amazing. I have figured out how to go out to go potty and I like my kennel. I really like a kennel or couch with soft cushions. I also love car rides and I just sit in the backset watching the world go by. I am in a home with lots of other dogs and I like them. However my foster mom thinks I am a princess and would like to be in a home with no other dogs or maybe just one more. I was a bit uptight around other dogs when my pups were around and before I was spayed but every day I am getting along with them better. I have a foster pig in my home and I try so hard for the pig to play with me but she has no interest.

It is unknown how long she was left on her own, but she loves human contact. While she tolerates females, her preference is males. Unlike most Beagles, Anna Belle is very quiet. I have only heard a very soft howl once. She likes to be held and loved on, but when she's had enough, she goes to her crate. Loud noises and sudden movements can also send her to the safety of her crate.She goes outside to potty most of the time and we are working on being accident free. She does well in her crate during work hours.Anna Belle likes to eat and drink in private, near her crate where she feels safe. She loves being outside, especially if her person is within sight.Anna Belle would most likely do well with an older gentleman who has time for walks and cuddles. She would love a fenced yard where her she could run, nose to the ground, smelling all the things Beagles love.This senior girl is so deserving of a loving home and a safe place to be for the final years of her life. One look in those trusting eyes and you are going to love her.",

My foster parents say I’m the sweetest but they really hope I will learn to trust others too so others can see just how sweet I am. They say if you take one look at my piercing eyes you can see into my soul. I came to Minnesota from Kentucky and was in a shelter for some time and I was so scared I would spend my days hiding under a pile of blankets. I didn’t find comfort in any humans until my foster parents and since learning to trust them I’m still struggling with new people. My foster parents say that a dog savvy owner will be very beneficial to help instill confidence in me and continue to work on my training. When I see new people I bark and growl and I can look really mean but I’m doing it because I’m scared. It would be best for me to be in a home that doesn’t have a lot of visitors and to have a bit of space outside because I have a hard time having fun outside when I’m making sure the neighbors are staying put. I stay in the crate during the day and I keep my crate clean and I’m going potty on a schedule!I love going on walks and my interaction with all dogs has been great. I really look to other dogs to know that everything is okay. Since my initial reaction to new people can be quite aggressive it may take me some time to trust you but once I know I’m safe with you, I will love you more than you can imagine.I would really love to go to a home that has another dog and a family that will love me unconditionally and continue to teach me that I can trust. I am a great cuddle buddy; I do great in car rides and just really can’t get enough love!

She was rescued from a Kentucky pound, where it looked like she had been neglected by a previous owner as she was very underweight. Annie is now in great health and waiting for her forever home in Minnesota. She is a very sweet affectionate dog, good with other dogs (loves to play) and people. Annie would love an adoptive home with a fenced in yard so she can move and explore and sniff to her heart's content. Hounds are fun dogs to take to fenced in dog parks, their love of discovery and activity is a great way to help you get out there and have some fun in nature too! Annie is house trained (although the first week in a new place may have a few accidents) and crate trained, is very treat motivated which makes training fun and is very loving to her people.Annie has some anxiety, and she is comforted in her crate. In her foster home, the crate is available to her with the door open when people are home, and closed when they leave.She'd make a nice family dog, or a companion for a single person or couple who would be able to take her out for walks, and wants a buddy to cuddle with at home. Annie is a little bit skittish, she's jumpy when she hears loud sudden noises.She would love to join an active family who can take her out on walks a lot, dog parks, obedience training, things to keep her stimulated. If she gets bored, she will pace throughout the house looking for something to do.She seems to be especially nervous around large bald men (maybe her previous owner was a large bald man and didn't treat her so nice). Sometimes when a new person comes in the door she'll get nervous and howl and pace, but she calms down after you let her know the person is ok or take her to another room where she feels safe.We haven't tested Annie with cats yet.She loves to give hugs :) Tiny kids may be too much for her (because she gets startled easily), but she's been good with the older kids (6, 7 and 12) in her foster home.If you'd love a sweet dog who needs some extra love, attention, patience, understanding and some training to teach her what it's like to be loved and part of a home, Annie just may be your girl. Take her in and give her a month or two of patience and training and she'll reward you with love the rest of her life.If you're interested in adopting Annie, or foster to adopt, please fill out the form below: redemptionroadrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms In order to foster, you must reside within 40 miles of Minneapolis, MN.

The person who had them agreed that they had waaay too many dogs that they could not care for any longer. We're glad they decided to hand these girls over since they were fending for themselves living outside under a porch :( Raven is now about 1yr and weighs about 50lbs.Raven's sister has found a home & now she waits... She has an independence/confidence about her. Her coloring is very unique since she has scattered brindle in her coat through her legs & on her face. Though her fur is not as long as her sister's was, it still has some \""depth\"" to it. We also believe there may be some greyhound in her since she's got very muscular back thighs and a 15in long tail that hangs just like one. Raven has not destroyed a thing in fostercare yet so we're hoping that she keeps up with that behavior.After she was spayed, she went through a growth spurt and we found that her one front leg is longer than the other so she has a bit of a 'lurch' to her gait. At the moment, this doesn't slow her down a bit and she runs like the wind. We got her xrays and the vet believes it's simply a case of the bones not forming properly & the poor nutrition she had when she was young. In the future she may need to be a tripod, but for now she's not in any pain and keeps up with all the dogs she's met just fine. She has typical puppy energy and needs some basic manners with other dogs & people. Raven will need training but she will make it SO worth it!

DOB estimate Feb 2017. She weighs 35 lbs. and absolutely loves to snuggle and be with her people. She's also a big fan of the great outdoors. Daisy is extremely food motivated, housebroken and walks well on a lead. She loves going for long walks. Still learning manners with other dogs but that could be because she was a mama and a little protective. She's spayed now along with updated vaccinations and microchipped. Daisy loves people and would be a good candidate for a second dog in the family. Daisy needs an adopter who has time to give her daily exercise and a fence is a must. 6' privacy fence best as she climbs chain link fences with great skill. Daisy is currently in foster care. I'm in a foster home, but if you are interested in adopting me, please fill out an online adoption application at http://colonycats.org/adoption_app.html to expedite the process.

She is being taught house manners and going through potty training and is making improvements. She’s hesitant to eat from a bowl but getting better each day, some treats she likes and others she completely ignores so definitely learning all she does and doesn't like. She's learning social cues from her foster siblings and is doing fantastic with both her canine and feline housemates. For now she ignores the cats and is starting to show playfulness with the dogs. Miss Fern walks well on a leash, loves snuggles with adults or children and her favorite place is cuddling close in bed or on the couch. She is kenneled/crated when her foster goes to work and does whine a little since she is trying to understand she won't be abandoned again.

Our rescue takes in numerous dogs from St Landry's Animal Shelter in Opelousas, LA where animal abuse and neglect is a persistent problem in this parish.  Economics and an antiquated view on animal care are major factors.  In the past, St. Landry Parish Animal Control euthanized more than 96% of the creatures it took in.  Progressive changes since 2014 have been made and there is a new mindset at the shelter.  Now, St Landry's works in concert with many rescue groups throughout the nation to relocate a vast majority of pets who find their way to the shelter. Minnie and Grizzly appear to be siblings as they highly resemble one another and seem to be about the same age, 3 months.  The shelter listed the 2 pups at 5 months, but when our vet examined them, he found they still had all their baby teeth.  They are quite tall for their age which may be why the shelter listed them as they did.  The third dog, Missie, was also listed at 5 months and was thought to be a sibling as well, but it turns out Missie is about 1.5 years old and she is actually smaller than the 2 pups!Grizzly has soft, expressive eyes that seem to look right into your heart.  He often looks to his humans for direction and assurance, and he will then flick his tail to and fro when you say, \""good boy!”   He is a shy, but happy fellow who loves all he meets after warming up to them.  He would do well with a canine mentor to show him the ropes and offer him security.Grizzly will be brought up-to-date on vaccinations and micro-chipped.  He is heartworm negative and will be ready for his forever family in mid July.   Adopters must commit to the spaying or neutering of their adopted pup before it reaches 1 year of age and must provide proof of neutering to SGRR.  Rescued dogs come with a range of needs - from behavioral to emotional to medical.  When approved applicants adopt such dogs, they agree to continue the rehabilitation we have begun.

Please direct any questions regarding your application status to:  ajpillinger@gmail.com   *  Since the early 2000’s, animal rescue workers have noticed an increasing phenomena called, “Black Dog Syndrome,” which is that black dogs tend to be adopted more slowly than dogs of other coloring.  As a result, there are more black dogs in shelters, and black dogs have a higher euthanization rate – purely because of the color of their coat!  In a recent survey done by the adoption website “Petfinder,” Petfinder member shelters and rescue groups reported that most pets are listed for 12.5 weeks on Petfinder, whereas, less-adoptable pets (such as black, senior, and special needs pets) spend almost four times as long on Petfinder. You may ask, \""what does this have to do with a Golden Retriever rescue?\""  Our rescue often goes a step further than basic rescue, by taking in dogs that might be thought of as “less adoptable” because of their physical condition.  We have expanded that to include these special black dogs, many often thought to be Golden mixes.  Since doing so, we have seen an overwhelming interest in these “black goldens,” and note that we begin receiving inquiries about them as son as we publish their pictures on our website!  Like all of our dogs, these pups are just looking for a family that can see beyond their coloring to their true “golden heartedness,” and to love them and make them their own!  Those who can, will be glad they did!    Thank you!About Our Rescue Before being approved to adopt, all potential adopters will be required to complete our online application and participate in our pre-adoption review process. The process includes the completion of an online application, a reference from the applicants' vet, a phone interview, and a visit to the applicants' home.  The application process helps us determine what type of Golden would be best suited for the applicants' life style.  In some cases, the specific dog you are interested in may have found a home before this process is complete or further assessment may indicate that this dog is not the right match for your family.  We are frequently getting new Goldens in need of a home, so we encourage you to apply and complete the application process so that when the right dog comes along you will be ready. The information provided on each dog is based on the observations of our vets, volunteers, fosters, and when available, trainers. While we do our best to report any and all issues, SGRR does not make any guarantees as to the health or temperament of any dog. Dogs evolve differently in different environments and we cannot predict with any certainty how the dog you adopt will behave and adapt in your home.SGRR Adoption Fees (subject to change)Puppies under 6 months   $650Young dogs 6 months - 6 years   $550Young dogs - Special Needs   $450Senior dogs 7 - 9  years   $450Seniors dogs 10 years and older   $350Senior dogs - Special Needs   $300Young Bonded Pairs   $850Senior Bonded Pairs   $750A contract is signed on the day of adoption.

Most of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  We do not have a facility to visit.  We are committed to our dogs before, during, and after adoption! To this end, the rescue retains an interest in each dog and our dogs can never be surrendered, re-homed, or sold. Should an adopter no longer be able to keep their SGRR dog, SGRR must be notified so that we can take the dog back into rescue and place it into another home.

Our rescue takes in numerous dogs from St Landry's Animal Shelter in Opelousas, LA where animal abuse and neglect is a persistent problem in this parish.  Economics and an antiquated view on animal care are major factors.  In the past, St. Landry Parish Animal Control euthanized more than 96% of the creatures it took in.  Progressive changes since 2014 have been made and there is a new mindset at the shelter.  Now, St Landry's works in concert with many rescue groups throughout the nation to relocate a vast majority of pets who find their way to the shelter. Minnie and Grizzly appear to be siblings as they highly resemble one another and seem to be about the same age, 3 months.  The shelter listed the 2 pups at 5 months, but when our vet examined them, he found they still had all their baby teeth.  They are quite tall for their age which may be why the shelter listed them as they did.  The third dog, Missie, was also listed at 5 months and was thought to be a sibling as well, but it turns out Missie is about 1.5 years old and she is actually smaller than the 2 pups!Minnie is so sweet and craves human attention.  She is shy and would do well in a home with another dog who can mentor her and help her gain confidence.  One of Minnie's favorite things is snuggling.  So if you're a fan of cuddling with your dog, Minnie is the one for you!Minnie will be brought up-to-date on vaccinations and micro-chipped.  She is heartworm negative and will be ready for the her forever family in mid July.   Adopters must commit to the spaying or neutering of their adopted pup before it reaches 1 year of age and must provide proof of neutering to SGRR.

But as long as she is by your side, that is fine with her.  Missie has a beautiful shiny black coat with fur that is a bit shorter than her friends' coats.  She is proof that good things come in small packages.  At about 38 lbs, she is the perfect size for just about anyone from apartment dwellers to those of us who are aging and can no longer manage a 70 lb dog. Missie is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, and micro-chipped.  Because her former owner did not keep her on heartworm preventative, Missie is being treated for heartworm.

Thank you!Our rescue takes in numerous dogs from St Landry's Animal Shelter in Opelousas, LA.   Animal abuse and neglect is a persistent problem in this parish - economics and an antiquated view on animal care are factors.  In the past, St. Landry Parish Animal Control euthanized more than 96% of the creatures it took in.  Progressive changes since 2014 have been made and there is a new mindset at the shelter.  Now, St Landry's works in concert with many rescue groups throughout the nation to relocate a vast majority of pets who find their way to the shelter.  Bella is another one of the dogs whose life has been saved!Bella is a sweet and petite Golden/Lab mix, or as we like to call them, \""black goldens!\""  :-)  She is thought to be about 18 months old and was picked up as a stray in St Landry's Parish, LA.  Sadly, no one came to claim Bella.  An animal shelter can be a very scary place, especially for a black dog, the least adopted color and most frequently euthanized.  Bella is lovable, and a bit shy when she first meets someone new, but she is a push-over for belly rubs!  She is good with other dogs, but has no known history with cats.  She weighs about 45 lbs and could probably stand to gain another 5 lbs or so.  She has a stunningly beautiful, glossy black coat and the kindest eyes you have ever seen. Our trainer is working with Bella on her leash skills.  In time, she will make an excellent walking or jogging buddy.  Bella will also learn basic commands, like sit, stay, and down.  She is spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, and micro-chipped.  Because her former owner did not keep Bella on heartworm preventative, she is being treated for heartworm.  She will be ready to come north mid July.  This sweet girl is not going to last! Rescued dogs come with a range of needs - from behavioral to emotional to medical.  When approved applicants adopt such dogs, they agree to continue the rehabilitation we have begun.  If you would like to be part of Bella's rescue story, and you have already been approved for adoption through SGRR, please contact Donna Toncic at: SunshineGoldens@gmail.com     to be considered to adopt Bella.           If not yet approved, please visit our website to learn more and to submit an online application:     http://sunshinegoldenrescue.com/adoption-info1.html  Please DO NOT use the ASK ABOUT button to contact us, about this dog, as that will delay our ability to respond to your inquiry.  Please direct any questions regarding your application status to:  ajpillinger@gmail.com Black \""Goldens...?\""Since the early 2000’s, animal rescue workers have noticed an increasing phenomena called, “Black Dog Syndrome,” which is that black dogs tend to be adopted more slowly than dogs of other coloring.  As a result, there are more black dogs in shelters, and black dogs have a higher euthanization rate – purely because of the color of their coat!  In a recent survey done by the adoption website “Petfinder,” Petfinder member shelters and rescue groups reported that most pets are listed for 12.5 weeks on Petfinder, whereas, less-adoptable pets (such as black, senior, and special needs pets) spend almost four times as long on Petfinder. You may ask, \""what does this have to do with a Golden Retriever rescue?\""  Our rescue often goes a step further than basic rescue, by taking in dogs that might be thought of as “less adoptable” because of their physical condition.  We have expanded that to include these special black dogs, many often thought to be Golden mixes.  Since doing so, we have seen an overwhelming interest in these “black goldens,” and note that we begin receiving inquiries about them as son as we publish their pictures on our website!  Like all of our dogs, these pups are just looking for a family that can see beyond their coloring to their true “golden heartedness,” and to love them and make them their own!  Those who can, will be glad they did!    Thank you!About Our Rescue Before being approved to adopt, all potential adopters will be required to complete our online application and participate in our pre-adoption review process. The process includes the completion of an online application, a reference from the applicants' vet, a phone interview, and a visit to the applicants' home.  The application process helps us determine what type of Golden would be best suited for the applicants' life style.  In some cases, the specific dog you are interested in may have found a home before this process is complete or further assessment may indicate that this dog is not the right match for your family.  We are frequently getting new Goldens in need of a home, so we encourage you to apply and complete the application process so that when the right dog comes along you will be ready. The information provided on each dog is based on the observations of our vets, volunteers, fosters, and when available, trainers. While we do our best to report any and all issues, SGRR does not make any guarantees as to the health or temperament of any dog. Dogs evolve differently in different environments and we cannot predict with any certainty how the dog you adopt will behave and adapt in your home.SGRR Adoption Fees (subject to change)Puppies under 6 months   $650Young dogs 6 months - 6 years   $550Young dogs - Special Needs   $450Senior dogs 7 - 9  years   $450Seniors dogs 10 years and older   $350Senior dogs - Special Needs   $300Young Bonded Pairs   $850Senior Bonded Pairs   $750A contract is signed on the day of adoption.  Under the terms of the contract, all adopters are required to bring their SGRR dog to a vet within 7 business days.  All dogs receive basic veterinary care prior to adoption.  However, if an adopter's vet identifies an illness that an adopter is not willing to treat, then the dog may be returned and a full refund would be provided. Most of our dogs are fostered in private homes.  We do not have a facility to visit.  We are committed to our dogs before, during, and after adoption! To this end, the rescue retains an interest in each dog and our dogs can never be surrendered, re-homed, or sold. Should an adopter no longer be able to keep their SGRR dog, SGRR must be notified so that we can take the dog back into rescue and place it into another home. We reserve the right to remove a dog at any time should we find the adopter is no longer providing proper care.  Adopters agree to follow up visits as needed.  Please be a ray of light for this Sunshine dog and make a tax deductible donation toward medical care and other expenses.   Every cent of your generosity goes directly toward the care of a Sunshine dog.Please visit our website at: http://sunshinegoldenrescue.com  to learn more about our rescue and to make a Donation to support Sunshine Golden Retriever Rescue.

He loves playing and goofing around with other dogs. His foster mom says \""Ruston is the happiest dog I've ever met. He just doesn't want to be touched unless he initiates it.

He is going to need a quiet, mature home alongside another dog and owners who have had dog experience, ideally shy dog experience, who can be his best advocate and understand he'll need to take his time and some help learning new things like leash training.

Willow was saved from a high kill shelter in Louisiana when she was 4 yrs old. This girl almost faced death not once, but twice, but you wouldn’t know it.“Today, you wouldn’t know the journey she has been on. This happy go lucky affectionate girl knows all her commands, is fine in and out of a crate, and loves her people. She loves children and one of her favorite things is to find a patch of sunlight in the backyard and bath in it. This smart loving girl gives kisses and has figured out every puzzle game. She can be redirected from barking with treats and she has never destroyed anything. No counter surfing, no chewing on things that don’t belong to her, and she likes to be touching you, and when she truly trusts you she may even end up curled up in your lap or sleeping with you in bed.” This is an excerpt from her story and I would encourage everyone to read her entire story and see if she could be the right dog for your family! IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTING ONE OF OUR DOGS... please visit us at www.luslabs.org and fill out an adoption application.  Once submitted, one of our Adoption Coordinators will be in touch!",

He is super sweet, and devoted, and is loving, funny, and affectionate. He does occasionally display his feral beginnings, but is easily managed. Matty will do best in a home with other dogs, and where the humans are patient and understanding.****22 September: Matty is currently one of the farm favorites. He is so sweet and gentle, he loves everyone and is a super cuddler. He has learned that people really like to pet and rub, and that that feels so very good. Matty will make such a wonderful companion for the right home.****UPDATE: 4 July -- Matty is a super sweet little guy who is just looking for love. A southern boy with an angel on his shoulder, Matty came to us from one of our partner organisations in Louisiana. Picked up as stray, Matty has obviously not had a lot of handling in his young life, and does take a day or two to trust, but he loves hanging out with his humans, and dogs, too!! Matty can be a little tough on cats, so a home without cats would be better for him (and the cats!).Matty is crate trained, appears to be housebroken, and is learning how to walk on leash. He will do best in a quiet home without young children (we don't really know how he is with little ones, though he was fine with a toddler outside here.), and , and would be happy with lots of walks and good play time.For more photos, please see our facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/mabcr.org.

He is slightly taller than a standard Beagle and weighs in at 35 lbs and is about 5 years old. When DANIEL arrived we noticed his left eye was very cloudy. Our eye vet confirmed that DANIEL had glaucoma and was blind in his left eye and, unfortunately, the pressure in that eye was 75 against a normal eye pressure of 10-20 mmHg! This would result in DANIEL being in quite a lot of pain! Since DANIEL had just been neutered and treated for heartworms it would not have been prudent to perform surgery to remove the eye. So we too the opportunity to drain the fluid from the eye and administer some eye medications hoping to lower DANIEL’s eye pressure. Unfortunately, after 2 weeks his pressure was still 68. While the standard solution use to be to just remove the eye in these cases, after consultation with DR Mohoric, we decided to try “Ciliary Boy Ablation (CBA) where they injected a medication into DANIEL’s eye to kill the cells that were producing the fluid that was responsible for the high pressures and high pain. Wee, I was ecstatic today when DANIEL’s eye pressure was “7”! So DANIEL is no longer in pain and was able to keep his eye, which is much more cosmetically pleasing.- So DANIEL is ready for adoption! He loves to gather lots of towels and blankets and make his own bed and, if possible, he would prefer it be on top of a table or in a chair.",

He is definitely a striking pup and friendly! He needs his own home. As we work with him over the next week, will find out more about him.KNOW YOUR CATAHOULAS!The Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog once known as The Catahoula Cur is a medium to medium-large dog that is well muscled, and capable of performing a variety of tasks.The feet of the Catahoula are webbed very similar to that of a duck. Most dogs have a webbing between their toes, but, the web of a Catahoula is very prominent and extends almost to the end of the toes. This fully webbed foot enables the Catahoula to work soft marshy areas very easily, and aids them in being great swimmers.The eyes may be blue(glass), green, brown or amber. They may have two different colored eyes, or may have \""cracked\"" eyes. An eye is considered cracked when two different colors appear within the same eye. This could be as much as half of the eye, or as little as a different colored streak running through the eye.The Catahoula is very wary of strangers but is at home with children. If a child and pup are allowed to grow together, you will not have to worry about your child. You will have a built in baby-sitter. As with any dog, you must be cautious when introducing him to new people. Catahoulas know what and whom they like, and I've found them to be an excellent judge of character. You will not be able to force this dog to like someone if his instincts tell him otherwise. His family comes first and that's who will receive his loyalty.The Catahoula is not an aggressive dog, but it is assertive. This dog will not tolerate being mishandled, mistreated, or attacked. It will defend itself to whatever means necessary. There are some breeders that refer to their dogs as aggressive dogs, but I have found that this is a reference to the manner in which they work. The Catahoula is a dog that will take charge when it is necessary. It is naturally protective of what and whom it thinks it owns.A Catahoula requires a minimum of one hour of running exercise each day, rain or shine. If the dog is kept outdoors, this is not a problem, but, if he is an indoor dog, he must get this exercise. Daily walks or runs in a yard are sufficient, but they are necessary. Since this dog has the inherent nature to herd and track game, he needs the exercise to release some of that pent up energy.You must be ready to teach and exercise a Catahoula. If not, he will eat your house. The Catahoula will not let you forget that you own a dog. If you do not have the time and energy it takes to train and exercise an active dog, then the Catahoula is not the dog for you. To describe what a Catahoula is like is almost impossible. You really have to own one to understand these dogs. Once you own one, you will be amazed that this dog already knows what you want, and what you are going to do. You will swear that the dog can read your mind, and he will out-think you, if given the chance.Adonis has a once in a lifetime chance of having a great home! Are you the perfect one for him?

Since relocating to Michigan from Louisiana, he has been working on his leash walking, crate training, and learning some commands.  He’s really been focused on playing with his doggie foster siblings and taking naps in the sun.  He’s made amazing strides learning to trust people, working on his surgical skills by unstuffing toys, and his yard inspector skills by looking for places to sneak out.  If you’re looking for someone to sing you a song while you get his dinner, Tiny can’t wait to meet you!  Tiny is neutered, micro-chipped, and up to date on all his vet care.

I am potty trained on a scheduled and have also let my fosters know when I need (or want) to go outside. I love exploring the outdoors! Me and Abbee are crate trained however we are much more content to be cozied up next to each other. I greet everyone with a little dance. It’s pretty impressive how high I am able to jump, but just give me a little reminder and I’ll show you I’m a pro at sitting too! I get along okay with the two younger medium size dogs here but they don’t realize they are a lot bigger and I feel like I’m going to get trampled on when we try to play so I just stick with wrestling with Abbee. I’m interested in the cats but mom is trying to teach me to be respectful towards them. The kids here (9 & 12) our great napping spots!

Bandit is 7 years old. He has been with the same family his whole life. As our family grew, with a toddler and another baby on the way, Bandit is starting to need a different family life. He truly is a sweet, loving and smart dog. He needs lots of exercise. He loves to cuddle, and is good with children over the age of 10. He does have anxiety, for example he is very sensitive to clicking noises, fans, blowing noises (such as blowing out a candle). Before we had children, my now husband and I were able to train Bandit quite easily to be more tolerant of these things, but as our attention gets drawn away from his behavioral training, he does still struggle with these, and some other, daily household routine noises. He is housebroken, and gets along with other dogs (has lived with a Sheltie for most of his life without issues). He is up to date on all shots, is fixed, and has had consistent veterinary appointments. Serious inquiries only. This is a very difficult decision for us, and would love to have an “open” adoption, where we could still see Bandit on occasion, at your convenience of course.",

He came to us earlier in the year and since then, he has learned to use a doggie door and is getting much better about housetraining. He gets along with all the dogs in his foster home, but he is fed separately because he is always hungry when he gets to eating, he snatches it up out of the bowl like he is starving. We think this is because he was never fully fed when he was growing up. He may jump on another dog while food is being given.He is very friendly and strong. He pulls on the leash, but we are getting a trainer to work with him on leash and other good behaviors. She has proven results on working with young and very good dogs like Baz.

She is likely best as an only because she seems happier that way, but she is living with dogs in her foster home. She most definitely cannot be with cats. Angel has good indoor manners, walks well on a leash and rides well in the car. She is happiest when she has enough exercise and a fenced yard to play in would be an excellent idea.

Our main website, www.bigfluffydogs.com has more information about us and the rescue process. NOTE TO EMAILERS FROM PETFINDER: WE DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL INQUIRIES WITHOUT AN APPLICATION. WE REGRET WE CANNOT RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL.We do our best to provide accurate information, but adopters must understand that each home is different and the dog may behave differently in a new home. Dogs are creatures of their environment and you help make the dog what it will be. Homes considering adopting a puppy must be prepared for: 1.) Flexible schedules for potty training. Puppies can only hold it for one hour per month of age (ex. a 4 month old puppy can only go 4 hours without a potty break). 2.) Crate training until the puppy is at least one year old, to prevent chewing on inappropriate things when you can't supervise. 3.) Socialization: The more positive and varying experiences as a puppy the better, both in and out of your home. 4.) Puppy behavior and life stages are equivalent to a human toddler. It takes at least a full year to have a calmer, well-adjusted dog. Patience is required and when your dog's behavior is a positive experience for you and those around you, your patience will be rewarded ten-fold for years to come. Please do not consider adopting a puppy if you have not thoroughly thought through the pros and cons of having one. So many people end up returning them after 3-5 months because they didn't realize the amount of work involved in raising a puppy. Patience, appropriate toys, socialization, and obedience training are all musts. All are time consuming, and can be expensive. All Dogs require supervision with children and obedience training. Adopters that want to have good dogs must be prepared to put the time and effort into training a dog. Any dog requires work and effort, but a well trained, well socialized dog is more than worth the effort put in to get them there.",

She was a stray an not much was known about her.She then caught the dreaded Kennel Cough and was placed on the Euthanasia list.  An amazing family stepped up to save her life.  She was acclimated into their home and treated like their own.  She is now ready to spread her wings and find her forever home.This is what her foster mom has to say:Molly would do well in a home with adults and children over 12.   I think she would do fine with another dog but should be introduced slowly. She enjoys playing with my large male Pit Bull. She loves to go on walks and explore the city, but I don’t consider her a high energy dog. Quirks:  Molly loves getting her belly rubbed and will keep bringing your hand back for more.  She enjoys going on walks and meeting new people, and then coming home and lying in the sun. Issues:  IssuesI have not had any issues with Molly.  When walking if she sees another dog she pulls a little bit on the leash, not in an aggressive way but more of a nosy way.  I have been working on redirecting her attention. She will sit for treats and let the other dog walk by. When she is not crated Molly is allowed to roam freely and she has never had an accident or been destructive. She will go to her crate on her own to relax with the door open.   I have been working on extending her time with the door shut.  I will give her a Kong Toy filled with treats and a little peanut butter when I shut the door. In summary:  Molly is an absolute sweetheart who loves to be with people. Often there are multiple people at home and she makes sure that she visits with everyone.  She is very smart and wants to please.  I am super impressed at how well Molly has dealt with change. She had the house to herself for the first month, but for the past 2 weeks she has been living with my 3 other dogs (Chi-mix, Pomeranian and Pit Bull), who unexpectedly returned from their stay in Maine.   After a slow introduction period she warmed up to them and now happily tries to play with my large male Pit Bull.",New York

This magnificent one and a half year old, black Labrador Retriever mix came to us from a big city Animal Control facility, where she spent some time after a lackluster owners abandoned her. She was rail thin and gaunt when she entered the city shelter system, and took some time to adjust to her harsh surroundings. When Wednesday came to our Rescue, she was a wild child, a Black Beauty in need of some firm, loving leadership. It was painfully obvious that her owners had missed all of her social development cues, and woefully neglected her manners and leadership training. Wednesday was as precocious as her Addams Family namesake, and seemed to feel that her opinion was warranted on just about every subject.In no time, Wednesday has developed into a canine thoroughbred, brimming with potential. An energy and personality match is key to Wednesday's happiness. She is a high energy, athletic dog who needs alot of outdoor exercise. She would gleefully keep rigorous pace with an avid runner, hiker or powerwalker, and seems to thrive in the brisk country air. No doubt about it, Wednesday needs an active adopter, but, also one who is extremely proficient in leadership and obedience training. She is not a dog for the casual or inexperienced adopter.Wednesday largely appears to be Labrador Retriever, but we also suspect some Border Collie in her DNA. She is a lean, tall dog weighing 47 pounds, and is extremely graceful and athletic. She runs with great speed, and could be an agility champion. Wednesday has the energy and intelligence that we see in this high strung Herding breed, as well as the mischievious and impertinent tendency that sometimes occurs when Border Collies are under exercised and bored! As a double dose of working dog, Wednesday definitely needs a job, and she is a natural at obedience work. She knows all her basic commands, and has passed many of the Canine Good Citizenship tests. She handles beautifully on lead, and heels nicely. Wednesday still needs some polish on her stranger manners, since she may, on occasion, greet someone rudely, but motivated adopters should be able to work her through any issues by employing her well honed commands. In the right hands, Wednesday will become a fantastic, well behaved companion.Wednesday would fare best in an adult home, with adopters experienced in handling large, active breeds. She would overwhelm toddlers and seniors. She could easily join a multi-dog home, with another active, well trained dog, but sometimes, unruly and ill mannered dogs press her buttons. We have not had her around cats, but she would most likely chase them beyond their tolerance level.Wednesday has respectable house manners and is mostly housetrained. She will need some finetuning on her potty routine as she transitions to a new environment. Wednesday is in good health, and has been spayed. She has been vaccinated for rabies, bordatella, and DHLPPC (distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, parvo, parainfluenza and coronavirus). She has had the 4dx test, and is negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. She has been microchipped and dewormed, and is on monthly flea/tick and heartworm treatment.If you are interested in Wednesday, please write to Denise@eskiesonline.com or call Denise at 860-908-9738.Eskies Online is a 501(c)(3) Multibreed rescue group that serves unwanted American Eskimos and other dogs in need.

This beautiful, robust boy is a victim of circumstances. His doting owner lost her home, and desperately tried to find housing to accommodate her beloved companion, whom she had raised from a pup. Hero's Mom took up temporary residence in a local motel, until she could get her bearings, but Hero was booted out by the motel manager. After a tearful goodbye, sad Hero was left in the care of a well-respected town shelter, who pled his case to us.Hero appears to be a handsome mix of black Labrador Retriever and Border Collie. He has the physique and color of a black Lab, and the white tuxedo markings and black speckled white socks that suggest Border Collie. At 50 pounds, Hero has a solid, muscular build, and yet is easy to handle on lead. As a combination herder and retriever, Hero loves the outdoors, and has a hardwired work ethic that needs to be channeled through exercise and obedience work. Hero sometimes seems unsure of his place in the world, and needs to join a home with a strong pack leader, willing to provide the structure that he needs to to thrive. Hero gives the impression of caution at first, as he sizes up strangers, but warms quickly to a gentle touch. Adopters will need to be comfortable putting boundaries between Hero and strangers: he can become overzealous in guarding his person. He would be the ideal watchdog.Hero seems subdued and intimidated at times, in the midst of our busy foster home, and we sense that a quiet, adult home would suit him best. He is not a big fan of change, and a steady, quiet routine will serve him beautifully.  Hero would be the ideal walking or running companion for an active single or couple. He loves the outdoors, can keep a brisk pace on a hike, and longs to make a one-to-one connection with a strong human personality. Hero could easily join a multi-dog home with another well-trained, calm dog, but cats are a definite no-go.Hero has progressed nicely in his basic obedience training. The obedience work serves him as a job he can take pride in, and he performs the commands beautifully, either for praise or treats. Obedience training is key to providing the working breeds with the purpose and focus that they need to live happily in a domestic lifestyle.Hero has good house manners and is house trained and crate trained. Adopters should have appropriate patience, and expect to troubleshoot the occasional accident that will inevitably occur during Hero's transition to a new home. He is in excellent health, and is at an ideal lean body weight. He has been neutered, and has been vaccinated for Rabies, DA2PP (distemper, adrenovirus, parvo and parainfluenza), and Canine Flu. He has been boostered as needed, and has had the 4dx test: negative for heartworm, lyme, earlichia and anaplasmosis. He has been dewormed, and microchipped.

Please remain calm and reassuring when you approach their kennels and give them time to get comfortable with your presence. As good as staff is to these animals, it still is not the same as being in their own home with their own people who love them. According to info on her cage card, SNICKERS chases cattle.

She is up to date on vaccines, microchipped, heartworm negative, on flea/heartworm prevention, house trained, crate trained, and leash trained. Alice has returned from Wonderland! Alice came to us after being picked up running stray here in Virginia Beach, VA in 2012. She was adopted later that same year, but it wasn't working out and the family wanted to return her in April of 2013. She went missing the day we were supposed to pick her up from the adopters. Days, weeks, months went by with no news. We presumed she was dead. Then, in October 2016 (nearly 3.5 years later!), we got a call from an animal control facility in Maryland saying they had caught a stray Akita in a trap and her microchip said she was Alice and belonged to us! We were floored and beyond excited to get her back! She's in great condition for being missing for so long, and we are grateful to whomever had been caring for her. At some point when she was gone, she tore both her ACLs and never received medical attention for it. She doesn't need surgery, but she has arthritis in both legs, so she'll need to be on a joint supplement. She's on supplement and back on her thyroid pills and feeling great. :-) This amazing girl with the incredible story is great with other dogs (she goes to daycare!) and very friendly with people. She would do well as an only dog or in a home with the right male dog.",Virginia

I’m Rosie, a 25-pound mixed breed all the way from Mexico! I don’t know my exact birthdate, but I’m somewhere between 1 and 2 years old. I’m a little bit shy, but I love my humans and will follow you around the house in search of a comfy spot to curl up. I was hit by a car in my early life, so sometimes I’m a little bit slow to get up, but once I’m up, I’m off! I’m looking for an active family that can take me on daily walks—and I’d love a fenced yard so I can run around. I don’t have a lot of experience with cats or kids, but I love to play with other dogs and would be really happy to have a canine sibling. I am good with my house training and don’t mind my crate—sometimes I chew on things if I’m left alone for too long. If you’re looking for a playful companion who also loves to cuddle, I’m your gal! All CAWS animals are fixed, microchipped, and vaccinated. Her adoption fee is $200.00.

Spayed. Microchipped.No one knows much of my past but I was born in Egypt and became a US citizen in 2014. When I first came to the states, we were all under the impression I was paralyzed- not knowing why or how, but I couldnt use my back end. Either way I was a happy girl, just thankful to be loved and cared for. My foster mom got me a wheelchair but she was convinced I could someday walk. With her dedication and both of our hard work guess who doesnt need a set of wheels anymore? Me! Yeah, I may have a few scars, walk with a wobble (which I may add everyone finds adorable) and have to go outside more than most but all in all, Im a walking machine! The only thing that I havent been able to master yet is a full set of stairs- I can handle up to 5 but I get nervous about doing more- Ill get there though! Because of my past, being able to hold needing to use the bathroom can be a bit of a struggle and Ill need to go out quite often- nothing crazy but more than your average dog. Right now my foster mom keeps me in a pen at night just in case an accident happens. Did I mention that I literally adore any living thing put in front of me? Dogs, Cats, People...I would be a great addition to any family!Transport to any approved home within the US can be provided at no additional fee. Currently Yasmini is located in Michigan.

She has an exuberance for life that radiates in everything she does. We're thinking this little love is a sweet blend of Hound and Boxer born sometime around the end of November 2018. She's extremely smart, learns quickly and LOVES to learn! She was quite the \""problem child\"" as a very young puppy, but with strong leadership from both humans and other dogs she's come amazingly far! She's smart and active, and will make a great companion for a person or family that'll make her a priority to ensure she gets the continued exercise, leadership and structure she needs to thrive. Just by the nature of demands and priorities, a household with children is not the best fit, even though she is good with children. She's house trained and crate trained (though she prefers to be loose), and is learning not to pull on leash. She's excited about the prospect of going to puppy training classes with her new human(s) - she already knows \""sit\"" and \""down\"" and almost has \""stay\"" mastered! She'd love a fenced yard to play in, but daily leash walks for exercise, business and adventure will work, too. She finds kitties interesting, but with her prey drive she would either need a very slow introduction to a resident dog-savvy cat or no cats in the home at all.Honey Buns is a delightful cuddler and whoever gets her should enjoy this to get the most out of the love of this sweet girl! She LOVES car rides and baths and chasing (and stalking) a soccer ball around the yard! There's so much more we could tell you about this little love! Fill out an application today and Honey's people will get right back to you - and tell you all about her!Honey Bun's Story: She was rescued from a church in a rural area in Mississippi. A young adult went out and got all the puppies at only 4-weeks old and left the momma dog who was feral behind. Our rescue partners knew it was too soon to have the puppies pulled from their momma so one of their employees went out and trapped her and convinced the girl that took the puppies to surrender them to the shelter so that mother Ramona could finish weening them. Honey was a bit sassy as a sister with her siblings - with older and larger dogs she has learned her place.Adoption Fee: $585To apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.

Fortunately for Bizzie, her future's looking ever so bright! We're thinking she's a blend of Chow Chow and Shepherd probably born sometime in 2014 or 2015. She has been fine with adult dogs and puppies; she has not been introduced to cats. She's been great with all adults, and though she has not lived with children, we think she would be okay with older, dog-respectful kids. House training and crate training are in the works, and she seems to do fine on leash. A dog who has lived on a chain for years, like Bizzie did, can have a tendency towards guard dog behaviors and though she has not shown any of these tendencies, her adopters will likely need to work with a professional trainer to help her accept strangers and work through any fears she might exhibit.Bizzie loves to run and play with other dogs, people and toys! She rides well in the car while crated, she's very calm. Though a fenced yard would be great to get in some running and playing, daily leash walks for business, exercise and fun will work just as well to keep her happy and healthy. And to keep that canine mind sharp, think puzzle toys and games. Bizzie really just wants to find a forever home where she'll be loved and cared for. Could that be your home? Fill out an application today and her people will get right back to you!Bizzie's Backstory: Bizzie truly deserves a wonderful life. Her first 3-4 years were very hard. She was from the south side of Jackson, Mississippi, and was tied out on a 6-foot chain to be used as a guard dog. Her shelter was limited to a carport, no matter what the temperature or weather was like. She often did not have food nor water, except when a neighbor was contacted for dog food. After that, the neighbor often checked on her and would feed her and give her water. We know that Bizzie had at least one litter of puppies that a rescue took, but Bizzie was left behind. However the rescue did provide a spay for her. Bizzie’s friend finally convinced her owner to relinquish her. When the vet checked Bizzie, she did have heartworm, which has been treated and she is now clear. At first, this pretty girl was scared when anyone approached her with a leash - maybe she was afraid she would be tied out again. Of course, we know that this will never again be the case!Medical Note: This dog has been treated for heartworm disease with melarsomine injections. Once treatment is completed and the dog tests negative for microfilaria, the dog will be cleared to resume normal activity and able to be adopted. Untreated heartworm disease can cause lasting damage to the heart, lungs and arteries, and can affect the dog’s health and quality of life even after the parasites are gone, possibly presenting as medical complications and/or new conditions in the future. This dog showed no symptoms of heartworm disease before or during treatment. A good resource for more information on heartworm disease is: https://www.heartwormsociety.org/pet-owner-resources/ heartworm-basics. Please check with your vet if you should have any questions or concerns about this condition, and discuss any concerns you may have with your SOS Adoption Counselor.Adoption Fee: $585To apply for this dog, fill out an adoption application on our website: www.sosarl.org/aa/**Additional info you should know - For most of our dogs, we are only guessing at predominant breed or breed mix.

My name’s Bailey and I’m a 2-year-old neutered male Chihuahua Mix. I came to Lucy Mackenzie with a bunch of my buddies from Mississippi earlier this summer. I was adopted soon after arriving, but things didn’t work out as well as we had hoped. The good news is that we all learned a lot about what I need in my new home. My continued obedience training is going to be very important. Some people think that smaller dogs can get away with things just because we’re small, but that’s not true. Boundaries and rules are really helpful and will go a long way towards my happiness. We also learned that young children confuse me quite a bit. I’ve met people of all ages here at the shelter, but in my home, it would be best if I lived with older, dog-savvy children only. I really like being around people, and will do pretty much anything to be near them. I’ve been known to climb up and over my kennel door here at the shelter, which is why I shouldn’t be trusted in a fenced in area left to my own devices. I will probably find a way out. The good news is that I love going for walks and playtime, especially with my favorite toy balls, so I promise you that we’ll always have a good time. If you’re looking for a new canine companion that will surely bring lots of love and joy to your life, stop in and meet me today!",

Walks on a leash are doable, but she gets anxious if pulled. It is unknown how she is with cats. Overall, she’s an affectionate but cautious dog that will do best with a gentle hand.Adoption fee includes: Full veterinary exam, spay, prepaid microchip, 4DX (heartworm/tick disease testing) dewormed, Rabies vaccine, DAPP vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, flea/tick and heartworm preventative while in rescue.

My name is Scarlet and I need a new home. I was adopted 4 years ago from a rescue, and have been living in Kingston, NH with my two humans ever since. I have a mom and an 11-year old sister. It’s been all about girl power until recently when the family dynamics changed. The mom says I’m a sweet, curious girl who craves attention. I like to be close and sit on her lap. I am convinced I’m a loveable lap dog, but I’m told I just don’t realize how big I am. I love my sister because sometimes we play and work on commands. I’m also house-trained and crate-trained. A doggie evaluator says I’m a friendly girl that just needs exercise and things to do. She feels I’m bored and need enrichment because when there’s excitement around me I tend to get jumpy and air snap. She says I don’t know what else to do because I was never taught any better. I do love chewing on things and hope my new home has some rugged chew toys and yummy marrow bones. Sometimes I get carrots to get my crunch on. Well guess what? Those carrots are part of a diet! I’m proud of my full figure but the mom says I need to get fit. I’m OK with that because I enjoy munching on frozen green beans with my kibble. So here’s the thing, I don’t do good with change and have become quite jumpy and nippy especially lately. Now, there’s a new baby on the way and the mom says I need a new home because I may accidentally hurt a little human. My nippy issues scare people so I need someone to help me follow the Golden Rule. I would love some mental and physical activities to keep me busy and gain confidence so I don’t act naughty. My ARK friends can tell you more.I would also like a quiet home since I get overexcited when there’s lots of commotion. If you could help me stay calm and focused, I know I’d be a lady to be proud of.  But when things get busy and noisy, you can place me in my crate in a quiet room. We’ll all be loving life if I’m not allowed to get super excited. The good news is any snippy snappy behavior can be redirected since I love treats and am willing to learn. This really works for me!I do need to be the only pet in your home. I am not a fan of cats and I just haven’t had the chance to make canine friends yet. So if you want a loyal friend and have a calm home, contact my buddy Mary Lou. Let’s meet! maryloumaria@yahoo.com",Massachusetts

He is a super laid back fellow who can be very shy in new environments, but once he gets acclimated he loves to play and give kisses. Dawson had a rough start and was found as a stray in GA. When he was pulled from the shelter He was emaciated and HW positive, but has since gained lots of weight and has undergone heartworm treatment. Dawson is also completely UTD on vaccinations, HW medication, and flea/tick prevention. He still needs to be neutered, but the vet requires 6 months prior to neuter after HW treatment, which will the end of June. Dawson is a special little fellow who will need a patient and loving forever home as he has some special needs. He is partially blind, but gets around quite well. He uses his sniffer to get around and once he gets used to his surroundings he maneuvers around without much trouble. Dawson loves to be outside and would love a home with a fenced in yard so that he could go outside and sniff all sniffs safely. Dawson walks well on a leash. He is still working on potty training, but with the use of belly bands he does pretty well in the house. Dawson also loves to be in his kennel. It is a safe space for him and he enjoys snuggling up in his kennel. Dawson would do best in a home with someone who works from home or someone who is able to come home at lunch time or arrange a dog walker to come and let him out midday. Anyone interested in adopting Dawson should understand his needs and be prepared to be patient when he first arrives at the home. He will take a little while to assimilate to any new environment, but once he feels comfortable he is a very sweet and loving dog who wants to be near his people. Please reach out if you are interested in sweet Dawson and his foster Mom will be happy to answer any questions. Dawson is located in New Hampshire.For questions, please contact Jclarkeacdra@gmail.com.COMPLETE AN APPLICATIONhttp://www.acdra.org/adoption-application",Georgia

Parsippany is 8 years old and is ready for a new start in life. You may have read about the large number of dogs that were recently removed from a place in NJ. Well this peanut is one of them and the MSPCA is committed to helping her find a loving home and offering ongoing support while she adjusts to a normal home life. Parsippany will need a very patient adopter to help her as she transitions to their home, by slowly introducing her to new things as she gains confidence. She is learning to walk on leash and is enjoying the grass and exploring outside. Housebreaking will also require consistency and patience as she has never had an opportunity to learn appropriate potty breaks. Depending on introductions, she may be able to join a home with a dog. A slow introduction to a cat may be okay too. Older, gentle kids that are able to understand that Parsippany will need time to adjust will be considered.

My name is Lt. Dan and I am a year old mixed breed dog. We think I might be an Australian Cattle Dog mix or something, but one thing is for sure: I'm 100% handsome! I'm even more handsome with three legs! Your eyes do not deceive you: I am tripawed and a lucky boy. I am awesome with other dogs but my foster mom says I'm not that great with cats because oh boy do I like to chase them. I'm pretty food motivated and will take all of the snacks you'll give me... but I need a new family to help me watch my figure because of my disability.Truth be told, I did not have the best start in life. I was dumped on the side of a road where I searched for my family and had to fend for myself. While looking for my family I was hit by a car. I was scared and lonely and was hurt really bad. I was so scared of people and it took three big scary men to catch me. They brought me to a hospital where I met my foster mom. She gave me pain medication and advocated for me. This is where the amazing Mel said foster mom could bring me into the rescue and make me better. They amputated my leg and my foster mom slowly gained my trust as I healed. As you can imagine I am still very scared around new people and strangers. I need my new family to come meet me a few times before I can go home with them. It would also be great if my new family has worked with a fearful dog before. I am getting better with trusting my foster mom about strangers and ignoring them. I love playing with my foster brothers and sisters and can play all day. I have foster kitties in the house that I will chase if they run. I am going to go play with my foster siblings now and my foster mom will tell you more.Lt. Dan is up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and on flea, tick and heartworm prevention monthly. He LOVES playing with other dogs and gets along with dogs of all sizes. He can live with dog savvy cats. Lt. Dan is fearful of new people and his adopter with be required to come to New Jersey a few times to meet him and spend some time with him before he can go to his new home. His adopters will also need to have experience with fearful dogs and will need to work with a positive reinforcement trainer. Once he learns to trust you, Lt. Dan will cuddle with you all day if you let him. He is a medium energy dog who just wants to be with his person. He will gladly occupy you on a long walk or cuddle on the couch all day with you. Because he had his leg amputated his adopters will need to be vigilant about his diet, weight and keep him exercised. Lt. Dan has had a rough beginning but with love and dedication he can overcome his past and be a loving member of a family. Could that be you?SOHO is a 501c3 public charity focusing on rescuing herding dogs in crisis on the East Coast. Your pets will need to be up to date on vaccinations and heartworm preventative in order to be considered for adoption. Lt. Dan does have some additional adoption requirements: his foster mom would like a potential adopter to come and visit Lt. Dan a few times before taking him home in order to help him bond to his new family. Please note that Lt. Dan is located in HIGHLAND LAKES, NEW JERSEY.",

He is estimated to 3-5 years old, and is full of energy. He is fully vetted. He was a feral in Window Rock, Arizona, Navajo Nation, wandering the tribal office buildings for at least the past year and a half. He’s a super intelligent and crafty “Rez dog” so he needs a very secure yard with a large area where he can safely run free as he’s accustomed to. He is an outdoor dog, but under the right circumstances he may do well inside too. He is intimidated by cats, and may have had a bad experience with them in the past, so a home with no cats is best. However, he is not aggressive towards cats at all and does not chase, he cowers away and won’t go inside his current foster’s home because of the cats. He is also wary of men. He does, however, love other dogs and would probably be happiest with another dog buddy. Leash training was a breeze for him - he loves going for walks every day! He has made so much progress in the past 4 months. He went from being a dog that you could not even touch or get close to, to one that craves affection and praise. He rode in the car and a crate to the vet successfully. I think with more exposure he’ll do fine with both. We don’t know everything that Brownie has went through, but he’s a survivor and he deserves a loving family that is patient and willing to give him lots of time and attention. In return he will be your loyal, ridiculously smart, loving friend.Brownie is vaccinated and neutered, and currently located in Gallup, NM with transport possible to surrounding areas.

My vet and foster mom have guessed that I am around 2 years old and an American Pit Bull Terrier or \""pit bull-type dog.\"" I was rescued from an overcrowded shelter in New Mexico. I will be available to adopt/go home after July 5th. I am currently completing a board and train program through High Drive Dog Company in Longmont, Colorado. Part of my adoption requirements include follow up training with High Drive (sponsored by CCR for 3 months), no other animals in the home, no children under 12, and no cities with BSL (breed specific legislation). It is preferred I am adopted to a home with a 6 foot wooden fence. These requirements are non-negotiable. Lemon would do best living with someone who has bully breed experience. Lemon weighs around 60 pounds, is crate trained, and doing well with housetraining. She can be vocal when she needs something, and is not appropriate for apartment/condo living.Lemon had a rough start to life; being kenneled 24/7 for 2 months straight prior to arriving in Colorado was a lot of stress. Lemon has worked through a lot of reactivity issues. She actually plays well with a lot of dogs. She is NOT a candidate for dog parks. However, she is always welcome to attend supervised playgroups at High Drive (please see http://www.highdrivedogco.com/ for more details about the company). Lemon is not a coach potato. She is bold, eager to learn, and ready to take on the world. Lemon needs to be challenged physically and mentally. She is funny and affectionate. This pup may have started out as a lemon, but she is quite a peach.If you are interested in adopting Lemon, please submit an application located on our website, www.coloradocaninerescue.org. We are asking for a $200.00 adoption donation. Lemon is spayed, up to date on vaccinations, and micro-chipped.

In addition, most dogs listed as potty trained will experience an adjustment period as they learn the routines in their new home.",

Farfel's immediately got a call describing how incredibly cute and sweet this Spaniel mix is..and the need to save his life. We immediately agreed and Jake became a very treasured Farfel's dog. He earned a ticket to a wonderful new life in Colorado with his great temperament that held every possibility for a great future.At 3.6 years old and 11 lbs, this very adorable pup is a blank slate waiting for positive input and guidance to be the best dog he's capable of being. We'd love to match Jake to a family that will spend lots of time with this very portable guy. He's a perfect size to accompany his family just about anywhere...and would love it. Positive reinforcement group obedience class will not only provide socialization and great skills...but will cement the relationship between Jake and his family.  He's so smart that he's a natural to succeed in learning his skills...and would be so excited at his success!  Jake always gets lots of attention when he's out and about with his rescuer...he's engaging (while a bit shy at first) and as sweet as can be.  He's also extremely eye-catching with his stunning tri-colored coat and gorgeous dark eyes that speak of so much wisdom. Jake has been identified as a Cavalier/Spaniel mix.. but we would never swear to it. He's just an adorable and fun scruffy guy that's irresistible! When Jake turns that gentle look in your direction, you can't help but smile at his engaging ways.  You can see a bit of a sign that this young pup has had difficult times. But not for him to be negative..a smile and a wag is more Jake's style. It's clear that he is working on leaving any pain behind.Farfel's Rescue is searching for either active retirees for Jake (he would be overjoyed with being the center of a loving family and the amount of time spent together). Jake would also be great with a younger family with dog-crazy kids. Jake, once bonded, will be a loyal best friend who would love nothing more than time together or socializing with friends. Jake would also enjoy time with dogs of similar size who can be gentle playmates. When you're only 11 lbs, even a well-adjusted pup can be intimidated by large, rambunctious dogs.  Jake is so grateful being out of the shelter that there's almost a smile on his cuter than cute face.  He is a very happy guy once he's comfortable...a bit of patience, treats and belly rubs will truly get this guy's attention as he's had far too little of all in his life.  Jake's rescuer is very happy to report that Jake is coming out of his shell more each day...he's blossoming.  She's very clear that Jake will be a wonderful and bonded family member when he has love and nurturing as a part of his life.Jake is up to date on his vetting, but has yet to be neutered. We're hoping that he will be fixed when he arrives from New Mexico, however rescue dogs are often overlooked in this city with too many dogs and not enough vets. If this is the case, Farfel's is happy to cover all costs for Jake to be neutered and microchipped at one of our rescue vets to be in line with our commitment to be a part of the solution to pet overpopulation. Jake will be arriving on transport in Denver on Saturday 6/8 or Sunday 6/9/19 (we'll update when information is confirmed). Applications are currently being accepted for this very sweet, engaging and loving best friend. An application can be found at http://farfels.com/farfels-rescue/adoption-form/. If interested, please fill out completely and submit.**PLEASE NOTE** Farfel's Rescue makes huge efforts to place our dogs with families that are excellent matches. We do this through our 6-page Farfel's application found on farfels.com (never through rescue site apps as they don't provide enough information) followed by follow-up phone interviews, home photos and reference checks. If you're truly interested in adopting Jake, please be sure to fill out the Farfel's adoption application. It's the only initial tool that we have to determine a great match for this very deserving guy. We're sorry, but in most cases, we're unable to get back to those that don't submit our application.

Panda may be your new furever buddy! About four to fiveyears old and 21pounds, Panda is looking for a family or person who will include her in their daily lives, take her on walkies, andthrow the tennis ball for her.She is a lot of fun and very attentive. She's very fast, agile, and confident! And she'll gladly defend your yard against invading squirrels.Panda currently lives with four much-larger dogs at her foster home and gets along great with them; however, she does take some time to warm up to newdogs. Panda may not be appropriate for a home with cats(it depends on the cat... a confident, stand-its-ground cat that will not hesitate to swat a dog to show it who's in charge may be fine). IMPORTANT: Panda's forever home needs to have a yard for her to \""do her business\""... she's quite particular about this. But she is housetrained, doggy-door trained, and crate trained.Panda is a very fun and playful dog (yet is generally calm and quiet around the house); she really loves to chase and retrieve tennis balls, play with squeaky stuffed dog toys (she will also retrieve toys if you throw them for her), and she is young and active enough to easily go for many miles of walking or hiking. And as was mentioned earlier, she's very interested in squirrel watching and will sometimes attempt to climb trees to get a better look. Pandaloves going on adventures and is a great car rider (doesn't get car sick; enjoys popping her head out the window occasionally to sniff the air, as long as the car isn't going too fast, under 40 mph or so).Panda is very independent and is more of a \""people dog\"" than \""dog dog,\"" meaning she's not particularly interested in befriending or playing with other dogs. Her foster people think sheis best suited to being an only dog, although she would likely get along fine with another dog.She mainlyenjoysbeing with her people, but otherwisedoes her own thing. When her foster people are busy or at work, she spends a fair amount of time during the day looking out the front window of the house (there's a dog bed under it)... again, those darnsquirrels.Panda is spayed, microchipped, up to date on shots, andready to go home to her forever home.

In the play yard he wanders around slowly taking in all of his surroundings and walks up to strangers like they're supposed to acknowledge how regal he is. We're thinking he's a Shepherd mix born sometime early February 2018, and we're also thinking that due to his suspected breed mix he will need an adopter who has the time and energy to make Xen a priority in terms of training and daily structure and exercise. He's the kind of dog who'll need a \""job\"" to do. Once he's been to basic obedience classes, he'll most likely enjoy advanced training like agility or flyball - he likes playing fetch and flyball combines fetch and agility. He's very motivated by treats and toys! Though a fenced yard is an ideal place to burn off some excess energy, daily leash walks for exercise, business and fun - with trips for off-leash play at a dog park - will work, too. This handsome dude is good with other dogs, can be redirected away from kitties that don't care for doggies, and he's been tolerant of kids he's met. He's not a super barker, but will let you know when visitors arrive - he's more apt to alert bark when crated or inside, rather than outside in the yard. We don't know at this point if he's house trained. He does walk on leash, but needs to work on not pulling. He has mastered \""sit\"" and is working on his crate training.Need a hiking and/or running partner? Xen's your boy! He also likes swimming so...summer beach trips! As active as he may be, he also likes to cuddle and chill out. Does he sound like the perfect fur-dition to your family? Fill out an application today for Xen Jen and his people will get right back to you!Xen's Backstory:He was picked up as a stray by a man who was visiting Mississippi's capital city from New York. He had two other pets that Xen did fine with when he found him, however he knew when he returned to New York he would not have space in his studio apartment for his new friend. He reached out to our Mississippi rescue partner for help. The finder neutered Xen Jen before he found us.Medical Note: This dog is being treated for heartworm disease with melarsomine injections. Once treatment is completed and the dog tests negative for microfilaria, the dog will be cleared to resume normal activity and able to be adopted.

She is super easy to live with, very adaptable and well mannered and lives to please you. She does however snore like a chain saw. She loves nothing better than to sit and doze near you, hangout on the back porch or go for short walks. She’s a nine year’s young 83 pond Mastiff mix. She hails from Manhattan so loud noises don’t faze her and she is well trained and socialized. She is looking for a home where people will dote on her, play with her and make her golden years special.Likes: Chicken, scratches and being near her people. She loves to bring you a toy to play tug of war, but she can be quite enthusiastic and sometimes get a little over excited. She loves sticks and balls and likes to lay outside and chew on something.Dislikes: She hates to disappoint and worries if she thinks you are upset with her.Personality: Very sweet, easy going, silly and playful with great manners.Temperament: Very trusting and let you handle her just about everywhere but she has some arthritis in her back end and is cautious about being touched there. She will follow her people everywhere, but sits on the closest dog bed or rug rather than right on top of you. She is a sweet and adaptable girl who just wants lots of love.Energy level: low but she does like to play inside or out for very short periods.Favorite activity: Sleeping, getting attention, sitting outside, finding a good stick, rolling on a dog bed on her back, mouth opened making silly happy noises.Good with: Other dogs and people. She always has a tail wag for other dogs and will bark a few times when people come to the door but goes in for scratches as soon as you greet them. She likes cats a lot but can be overenthusiastic – she does take cues to back off from cats well.Housetrained – YesCrate trained – No She doesn’t seem to have ever been in a crate and not interested in going in, but is very good left alone in the house. She doesn’t chew or get into the trashMedical issues – She is nine and has some stiffness in her rear end but she is able to do stairs ok now, however a home with no more than a few stairs would be best as she gets older. She is little so does like to get up on a bed, but needs help. She does seem to be slightly cross eyed at times, but she can see fine other than perhaps having some depth perception issues occasionally.She deserves a home where people can make a fuss over her and play gently for very short periods between naps. Older children if any would therefore be best. She is happiest when she can doze on a bed near you as you go about your business. Few if any stairs would be best as she enters her golden years.Fostered in Norristown, PA.Application Fees, Adoption Donations and Rescue Policy: Please know that 100% of our funds are used for rescuing the dogs.Our rescue policy requires the following:Adopters must have their primary residence in one of the following states: Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, and parts of North Carolina.Applications for giant breed dogs must be submitted by the property owner.Homes with children under 6 years of age will not be approved for adoption.Homes with children should have a fenced yard.Pets currently in the applicant's home must have a history of appropriate veterinary care.

Here is his video compilation:https://youtu.be/uWBNBKpJtPgMundo is 11 months old, male, 110 lbs, vetted, and will be neutered. Mundo is a purebred Saint Bernard from a breeder in New York that has since closed down. He will need an experienced home; he is an overgrown puppy that needs someone to understand the breed as well as dog language and the way he communicates. Yes he drools, sheds, and enjoys chewing on things but he is house trained! He is good with most other dogs but sometimes dogs do not like him (potentially due to him not being altered yet which will be done). He needs someone that will be soft with him but give him structure without intimidation or boldness that will put him on the defense. Mundo has been through a lot of changes which he did not take well. He does not like to be stared at nor have treats withheld from him; his past history is unclear. We do not know all of Mundo's background and what he has been through but it seems he has not gotten what he needs for a well balanced existence. He needs someone willing to continue working with him to teach him. Currently he would do best in a home without small children and strangers coming and going frequently. He would do best in a home without a dominant male dog; and another dog would be younger like him as older dogs seem to get annoyed with him. He will need someone who will be patient with him while he learns and someone that will keep him on the right path. He is a low energy dog that is content to take naps during the day and sleep through the night. He is not a pup to be taken lightly just because he is adorable; we do know in the right home and with the right input he will become a loyal behaved family member. He needs a very experience owner.If you are interested in adopting Mundo please fill out an Application at www.Passion-4-Paws.org (please make sure you have the Vermont site) thanks!Please note Fosters have 1st option of Adoption.Check out his Facebook page (please \""Like\"" us while you are there): http://tinyurl.com/y4dnwpd3Disclosure:Breed labels are often incorrect: we rarely know the genetic lineage of the dogs we rescue. Many shelters and rescues specify breeds based on appearance; however, research has shown that less than 2% of a dog’s DNA determines appearance!Passion 4 Paws does not practice the use of labels pertaining to compatibility with others or dog breed. Labels such as “dog friendly” and “child friendly” should be used with caution as they often over-simplify the personalities and behavior of dogs.",

My name is Ro, and I am an adorable pitbull mix. I am estimated to be 7-10 years old, but I certainly don't act like it! I love every person and dog I get to meet, but I chase kitties, so a cat free household would be best. I love to run and play; tug is my favorite game. I am working on my commands and know “sit” and “lay down.” My mom said “stay” is a work in progress, but I just love having fun with you! She also said I have the most ADORABLE FACE TILT when I’m being endearing! So more about me, inthe evening I love to grab a toy and cuddle up next to my foster mom and dad on the couch. I’m looking for my adoptive home. Awesome adoptive parents only please! I’m located in NY state in the Greater Albany region but can be transported for A LOVING FAMILY in the Northeast! And as my rescue and foster mom say, “only awesome applicants need apply!”Again I’m Ro and I’m taking applicants for an awesome forever!",

He is a 40lbs Pit Bull and when full grown will probably be around 50lbs.  Sonny was surrendered to us after being bought from a backyard breeder in Brooklyn.  As he got older and more energetic, it became increasingly difficult to exercise him.  Since being in our care he is thriving in his foster home where he is learning basic manners and getting much needed exercise.  Sonny loves every dog he has met, big and small and would do great in a home with another energetic dog.  Sonny loves children but because of his energy level we would prefer that he goes into a home with kids over 10 years old.  Sonny loves long walks and chasing balls.  Sonny is crate trained and almost potty trained.  He will definitely benefit from puppy training classes so he can learn how to be the perfect dog.  His favorite toy is a kong full of peanut butter which he prefers after a long walk.If you are interested in Sonny, please go to bfdaaa.com to complete an application.",

He currently lives with his mom & dad as well as 3 children (14, 2 and 5 months) and a 14-year-old \""sibling\"" named Pickle. As you can see in his photos, Digby \""digs\"" children, even the littlest ones!From his Mom:Although he is 6 years old, Digby is still very much a young boy who has a lot of love and spunk left in him. He is a wonderful family dog and loves children, snacks, pets, and snuggles. He loves to eat and is very responsive to food as a reward for training. He does know several, tricks too!!Sadly, like many other Pit Bulls, Digby does come with some emotional baggage. Since he was a rescue he has fear aggression issues only towards other dogs – never humans EVER - so he definitely would do great in a one-dog house unless someone has the patience to slowly introduce him into a home with another dog. We did it for 4 days at my in-law's house in Boston and by day 4 Digby was off leash and everyone was playing happily and he's lived peacefully with our Pickle dog since we got him.Digby really is a wonderful family dog & we are hoping someone will give him a chance in a new family home. Digby is NOT with 11th Hour Rescue but we are helping his family with the rehoming process.

She’s curious about everything and loves attention. She is very playful with her sister and absolutely loves giving kisses to any person or dog who wants them. I always joke around saying her ball is her pacifier because she has it with her the majority of the day and can be found sleeping with one in her mouth.Roo is always looking for love by strangers and dogs when we are walking around the city. Although she loves interacting with dogs outside of the dog park she has no interest in playing with them at the park because of her ball obsession. She also loves sleeping on the bed and loves to cuddle! She loves to curl up and be held at night and is a big fan of covers but she’s also okay if you leave her on the couch.Roo has lived with a small Chihuahua as I fostered one for a month and Roo seems to know her size with other dogs. She really wants to interact with cats as well when we pass them in the bodegas in NYC. She even knows which bodegas have them and stops and wags her tail watching and hoping they will one day come say hi. She’s good with every person she’s met and loves kids as well but does try to jump and give kisses when she’s overly excited.Roo is NOT with 11th Hour Rescue but we are helping her owner with the rehoming process.

This was their third time to the shelter when their owner was unable to care for them.Foster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SCSpecial Needs? Yes, I need to go to a home with Ceasar.Weight: 19 lbsHeight: 11 inSpayed/Neutered: YesAdoption Fee: $200 for Toby and Ceasar together! We're a team!Fence needed? NoWhat kind of home would be best for me? Toby is an experienced boy who needs an experienced owner. He is generally well mannered, but can be headstrong. Toby needs an owner who will show him consistency and love and teach him some basic manners.What is my personality like? 3/29/19...update, we have a volunteer working at the farm this week and she took one look at Toby and said he is not a yorkshire terrier. He's a silky terrier. So we're changing his description and after reading the breed description, I agree with her. Toby, like most Yorkies, is full of confidence and spunk! He struts wherever he goes without a care in the world. Toby loves to play with toys but he can be a little stingy with them. He is fine with most dogs, but does not get along with other male dogs that are strong willed like him. His favorite things consist of going for walks, riding in a car, eating every treat he can and being loved on by humans! Toby is an awesome bed fellow who enjoys happily snuggling under the covers all night. He does need to learn basic commands and correcting his leash pulling. Toby can be a little temperamental and likes things on his terms. He has been known to growl and show his teeth if you try to make him do something he doesn't want to do. He needs a confident owner that will help redirect Toby and teach him appropriate manners for handling situations he may not like. With a confident owner who knows their way around dogs, he's a perfect angel. Toby and Ceasar are the perfect pair, you can have the best of both worlds!How do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly, does not meet a stranger.Other tips and tidbits: Estimated Birthdate: 2/2/2009. Toby is a loving boy but he's a terrier. He can be stubborn. No cats please. The pair gets along well with some cats and not with others.House trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.Please note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.To apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.Please note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home.

NoWhat kind of home would be best for me? Cesar is a pretty easy going boy. He attaches quickly and then wants to be near you always. Owner experience level needed: 6 - More than 10 years as a dog owner. Has worked with at least one behavior issues that did not require professional intervention. OR has worked with one serious medical issue that required professional care (diabetes, epilepsy, Cushing's, Addison's, etc) Toby can be stubborn. Cesar does not share food. It is not hard to work with at all and he will happily eat in the same room with Toby as long as they are separated by a good 10 feet.What is my personality like? Caesar is a big, goofy boy. He has long legs, even for a standard poodle, and his lanky - almost goofy - trot is reflective of his personality. Caesar has clearly been a beloved pet. He walks very well on a leash, seeks the attention of people, and is generally mild mannered. He picks his person and bonds to them very quickly. Caesar has been raised in a home with another dog, but is most interested in his person. He happily sleeps in the bed at night and loves nothing more than to snuggle when you sit down. Caesar has a lot of life and love left to give some family. If you are looking for a loyal companion that will give you his entire heart, this boy is for you! Ceasar and Toby are the perfect pair, you can have the best of both worlds!How do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly but reservedOther tips and tidbits: Estimated Birthdate: 2/2/2009. Cesar had elevated liver values when he visited the vet back in May. We're not sure if this is just him or indicative of problems to come. He is a senior. He's living in the moment.House trained?

We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.Thank you for considering CPR.",

One day, she is sedate and even aloof to volunteers that visit, and other times she will playfully run in circles with her butt low to the ground. She really enjoys golf cart rides and loves to walk on a leash. She has been known to curl up in her oversized food bowl to take a nap. Minnie came to us from a New York rescue that usually only houses small dogs. They told us she had been adopted and lived in a home for 3-4 years, but was becoming aggressive towards smaller dogs when out on walks. She does guard resources from other dogs, so she would be best as an only dog. She has a thin mystery scar that runs across her chest and under her front leg. Our best guess is she was entangled in a thin wire that cut into her. She had entropion surgery on both eyes to correct the lids which were turning inward and causing irritation.",

She is located in Huntington NY. Please share.She is up to date on all shots. Tested negative for heartworm. On Heartguard (heart worm preventative) and Bravecto (flea/tick preventative). Spayed. 85 pounds. Good with children and other dogs. Not good with cats.\""Chloe is one of the sweetest, friendliest dogs you will ever meet! She adores making new friends, and loves everyone and every dog she meets. She is 2 years old, house-trained, wonderful with children, walks beautifully on a leash, and knows a lot of commands... sit, down (lay down), touch (touches hand), let's go (heel), roll over, couch (lay on couch), go to bed (lay on bed), leave it, and more thanks to extensive obedience training. She would love a fenced yard and owners who are home a lot. She would be hitting the jackpot if she got a doggy brother or sister of her own, too! She plans to bring her own toys and bed to her new home! Her family's recent move has them commuting much further to work, they have a new human baby soaking up most of their free time at home, and their new home doesn't have a fenced yard. Chloe is living for the weekends and is lonely during the week as she is alone from 8am-7pm with a short midday walk courtesy of a dog walker. Chloe has some separation anxiety which is managed with meds, behavior modification when needed, and calm departures during which she is given a food treat. Chloe's vet is optimistic that in a home where she gets more attention and exercise the meds could be reduced or discontinued. Meet & greets available by appointment in Huntington, NY.\""The contact information if interested in Chloe is meetchloe.ny@gmail.com and the google voice phone number is: 631-403-7774.",

Once your application is completed by you and approved by MASR, we will be glad to schedule your visit. We do NOT guarantee “housebroken.”  If the animal is listed as housebroken it is because he/she has not had accidents for a period of time moving forward in the foster home.  Some animals may regress during the transition to a new home which is why we do not provide a guarantee.  Patience and consistency is always key. Please Note: 100% of all the adoption fees collected are used to care for the animals, and pay our ever increasing vet bill.

Should you be approved and adopt an animal through MAS Rescue, you will receive a $10 credit to your adoption fee.3.  Paying the application fee is in no way a guarantee that you will be approved to adopt an animal through MAS Rescue.  All of the same standards in processing applications still apply.  See our policies and procedures: http://www.masrescue.org/pnp.html4.  By submitting an application and paying the $10 application fee, you agree to the terms listed above.

My name is Aramis and I am an 8 ½ month old beagle-mix that just arrived in Rescue with my 2 sisters, Jaci and Phoebe.  We were rescued from a Field Trial Breeder in the Carolinas… when he didn’t want us anymore, Penny Angels agreed to help us find our new homes.  We went to a foster home for a week and then were spayed and vaccinated before traveling to New Jersey.  We used to live outside in a rabbit hutch, but once we went to our foster home, we found out what we had been missing!  Simple daily comforts are new to us.  We are even learning how to play with toys and chew on Nylabones.  We will need to be taught some basic training, though, and would do well with the help of patient owners.  We will be using a doggie door to go potty outside in Rescue, so I guess we will just follow the ‘pack’ and learn from them.  We were told that we will have to learn new rules in your home.  We have been around children (in our previous home) and have had positive interactions with them.  Okay- here are some more things for you to know about me:  I am a cute red and white beagle-mix with a cool ‘heart’ shape on my head.  I was born on October 3, 2018 and currently weigh 30 lbs.  I share the same father with my siblings but had a different mother.  (Dad must’ve been busy!)  My foster mom thinks that I am mixed with Basset Hound.  I am a little shy but making progress each day, especially when motivated with ‘treats’!  I walk (and sniff) well on a leash.  I get along well with other dogs and enjoy playing with them.  I love running in the backyard with my doggie friends, especially when they agree to chase me!  I have such a playful style when I am outside:  I like to ‘sniff, run, and hop’ when I am with the other dogs.  My ears flop around in the breeze and the smile on my face tells you how happy I am to be outside and playing with my friends!  Would you like to add me to your family?  I will be at Petsmart in Mays Landing, NJ on Saturday from 11-3 pm.  If you are ready to adopt me, please fill out an application and submit it to Penny Angels today.  My adoption fee is $250.  An adoption application can be obtained by visiting the PABR web site at www.pennyangelsbeaglerescue.com. If you have any questions, please contact beagler534@comcast.net or emnase@aol.com, or call Penny Angels Beagle Rescue at 609-965-9476. Thank you!",REMOVE

He is neutered and up to date on his vaccines. We think his ideal weight will be 50-55 lbs.  He would make a great family dog. He is a little shy but is coming out of his shell more and more every day. He currently lives in a foster home with two other dogs and two young kids. He loves to play with the dogs and is very sweet and gentle with the kids. He is crate trained and is working on his house training. It seems like Dill has never been walked on a leash so he is quite scared to go outside of the yard but we are sure he will learn in time to love walks.  He loves to eat (as all Labs do) and is very food motivated which will make him easy to train. He would do well in an active household.  Dill would benefit from living in a home with another dog for confidence. As you can see in the 1st picture, he loves his sister Juno (black and white)His foster Mom is even taking him running with her.If you think Dill would be a good match for your family, please email:wjvolunteers@yahoo.com  and tell us about your family, home and other dogs.",

She has big pointy ears and loves to go hiking, jogging, and chase squirrels. She can also be a total couch potato and just sleep next to her human for hours while the TV is on. Pickles loves peanut butter, pancakes, Swiss cheese, and popcorn. She dislikes vegetables, cats, and not being allowed to catch the squirrels. Pickles was originally adopted 2 years ago from North Carolina and has been extremely well cared for as her previous owner is a veterinarian. She is in excellent health and she is house-trained, crate-trained, and knows a lot of commands. Pickles can be a bit nervous around new people and new large dogs and takes a little while to come out of her shell, but when she does she is a total joy! Pickles does best with slow, low-energy introductions and sometimes barks nervously at new people who come on a bit too strong. She loves to play and loves small dogs, but can get a bit defensive around large high-energy dogs at first. However, her best friend is a 90lb Great Pyrenees so she definitely can build trust with any dog as long as the introductions go smoothly!This family is heartbroken that they must rehome Pickles, but due to health reasons of their 2 month child, they have no choice. We are looking for the right home for this special girl - probably one without cats or small children since we cannot vouch for Pickles in those environments since she hasn't had enough exposure. Dogs will be a case by case intro. Just remember she needs calm temperaments in k9 friends.The OS has generously offered to forward all of Pickles belongings too!

Von, aka Mr. Von Troubles, has loads of Husky personality. He will keep you on your toes and keep you laughing!Von is a 3 year old Husky mix who weighs 65lbs. We saved Von from a kill shelter in NC. He had a very bad case of mange. Von grew even more sick in his foster's home and was diagnosed with Parvo a week after we saved him. Von was very ill and most dogs wouldn't have survived the combined illnesses. But our Von is an amazingly strong fighter! Not only did he survive being abandoned, mange, secondary skin infections and Parvo, but his Husky personality shines like no other!!!Von is full of life. He is an energetic, playful, submissive, and a truly affectionate Husky. He enjoys playing ball and tug of war. He is house broken and crate trained. He sleeps in his crate and will stay quiet all night long. He is a good eater, but will not over eat. He drinks a lot and needs to go outside frequently. Von needs about an hour of vigorous play each day. A fenced yard where he can run freely would be ideal. He has not demonstrated any tendencies towards trying to escape as some Huskies are known to do. He hasn't done very much digging either. He is excellent on a leash. He is vocal, but not a howler.Like most Huskies, Von is destructive to his toys and will chew other objects as well. When not crated he needs constant supervision to ensure he doesn't get into things he shouldn't. While submissive, he can be stubborn with following commands, but responds instantly to correction.Von is a very playful guy and loves to put toys in your lap. He will insist you play with him. He would do best in a home with older children. No cats or small animals! You must be willing to embrace the Husky life to adopt Von. Von is not your typical dog, but an extension of a family.Video: https://youtu.be/Q0FE_LjxGc8Von will be fostered in NC until adoption. We can transport him to MD or NJ for the right family!www.huskyrescueteam.org~~Husky Education And Rescue Team is a foster based rescue. Our dogs are in our foster homes all up and down the east coast. We do not have a facility in which you can visit. We find this a huge benefit because we learn our dogs and are able to educate our adopters on what it’s like to have them live in your home. Part of our process, once pre-approved, is to speak with the foster for the dog you’re interested in. If you’re still interested in adopting from our rescue the first step is to complete our adoption application online at www.huskyrescueteam.org/applyIf you have additional questions please email info@huskyrescueteam.org",

I walk really well on my leash, so I would be a great hiking buddy and get along well with just about everyone! My friends at Providence Animal Center say I could easily go home with kids aged 5+! I’ve met a few doggy friends during playtime at PAC, and based on those interactions, they also say I could go home with a furry friend! But not a feline - I’m just not a cat guy. At the end of the day, I love getting snuggles and attention from my people - that could be you! So I sure hope you want to meet soon because I’m so excited to settle into my fur-ever home.

I have gained confidence with a consistent routine, and with patience and reassurance from my past foster and the awesome human heroes that have saved me and are currently looking out for me. I came from North Carolina where I was wandering the streets, and the human that saved me did not know much about my past. However, a few things about me have been figured out:• I want to please and I will work hard to understand my new home and surroundings. • I love to be loved and give love right back.• I am insecure, but willing and wanting to trust.• I learn quickly, such as sit, down, stay/wait and I am ready to learn more.• New people worry me… so do new buildings. I do not like going into buildings/homes I’m not familiar with. I will follow when I trust, and especially if I have a dog buddy. • I tend to trust a woman more than a man. Men wearing hats scare me, but I will warm up to a man over time, especially if one of my dog buddies trusts him. • I realize I keep mentioning dog buddies. I love dogs. Dogs are my buddies!! They make me feel safe and I love to play with them. I am still learning that humans know how to play – that sometimes is so weird to me!• I SHOULD NEVER BE TRUSTED WITH CATS.• I like walks and am learning how to play fetch.• I am mostly housebroken, but I am still learning. I need a consistent routine.• I do OK in crates, but I don’t like crates and storms. I have been known to escape them.

I spent some time in a foster home and have been in Rescue with Penny Angels for several weeks, just waiting to start searching for my forever family.  I would love to have a home for the Holidays.I am approx. 6-7 years old and weigh 31 lbs.  I get along well with the other dogs in Rescue.  I enjoy the comfort of a cozy couch or a good doggie bed.  I have been doing well using the doggie door to do my ‘business’ outside.  I will be at PetSmart in Mays Landing, NJ on Saturday from 11- 3 pm.  Please fill out an application and submit it to Penny Angels TODAY if you have room on your couch for me.An adoption application for Dolly can be obtained by visiting our web site at www.pennyangelsbeaglerescue.com.

She is a southern belle from NC. Uma would love a new family to love her, play with her and give her lots of hug and kisses! Uma is hoping to find a home that is on the quieter side (she is a little scared of all the city noises), has a fenced in yard so she can run and play and has another dog-friend to keep her company.Your new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.Adoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.Foster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home.

Sometimes I go to daycare and play with my friends, and I’m often very busy playing with my foster sister—we love to wrestle and chase each other around the house and yard. I’m close with my trusted group of human friends and am always happy to see them, but it still takes me a while to understand that new humans are ok. I may not make the ideal first impression because I will probably be skittish and scared, but once you get to know me you’ll see that I love snuggling up with my humans and always come over to get some lovin’. My foster dad says that he knows the perfect family is out there for me, and in the mean time I’m learning lots here in foster care and I have made such progress from when I was in North Carolina when humans couldn’t even LOOK at me without me being terrified. I’ve come a long way and I know that my ideal family will understand that it’s a process and be patient as I learn new things. All of my human friends can vouch for me and let you know that I’m worth it (#humblebrag).If you’re a low-key person or family who is looking for a loyal, sweet companion then have your people call my people! As always, you can keep up with my adventures at http://www.instagram.com/senny_wise_and_hound_foolish and my foster dad is happy to answer any questions for approved adopters!  PS: I promise I’m not angry all the time even though my eyebrows make me look grumpy! > Pupdate 3/14/19>> Hi, everyone! Senny here, just giving a brief update on how I’m doing. I’m still making a lot of progress in my foster home and am making more human friends. They key is letting me approach them on my own terms and after a few meetings I’m comfortable with them. In fact, there hasn’t been a human I haven’t liked once I got the chance to know them without being pressured. I’m getting more confident on my walks, even down city blocks. Things still scare me but I’m able to recover MUCH more quickly and don’t stay in panic mode. 2/12/19It’s been a while so I thought I would check in and remind you that I’m still in foster care doing great, and my foster dad tells me he absolutely knows the perfect family is out there! I’m continuing to build my confidence and start to do some slow exposure to situations that have really scared me before, like meeting new humans or being in unfamiliar places with lots of hustle and bustle. Things still make me nervous but I bounce back quickly (before if I got scared I would be totally derailed for the whole day) and I know that the humans I trust are there to keep me safe and I can go to them for reassurance if I need to. I still absolutely love socializing with my dog and human friends at doggie daycare. I seek out the humans there to get petted and give hugs and kisses and I’m really comfortable with them. I had to get to know them first, but do you blame me? Why should any of us trust strangers? Once I am your friend, you’ve got a friend for life! I’m incredibly friendly and loving and I adore hanging out with my family! I’ve learned that it’s actually ok to go out in the snow—I wasn’t so sure about that before, but now I’m all about snow zoomies. I’m still on my medications for anxiety and they are working well. My foster dad is starting to do a little work with me on my overall manners, especially since I love to jump up on my human friends because I’m excited for hugs, and, like lots of hounds, I like to put my paws up on the counters to see if there might be any tasty snacks for me up there.  Who doesn’t love snacks? I’m making a lot of awesome progress and showing great progress. I still get scared and take time to get comfortable, but I have been showing over and over that with time, patience, support and love that I’m capable of being a relaxed and loving family member. As always, my foster dad helps me update my Instagram so everyone can stay up to date on my adventures! You can find me on Instagram @senny_wise_and_hound_foolishPupdate for 1/8/19Senny here, just wanted to give you an update on how I’m doing in my foster home! A little over a month ago I started on two medications to help me with my severe fear and anxiety, and they do seem to be taking the edge off. I’ve been going to doggie daycare a few days a week and that has been SO MUCH FUN and I’ve even made friends with the humans who work there! I will even approach them on my own if I want attention or to give kisses. My foster dad thinks that daycare is really helping me meet and get to learn that humans are nice with the help of other dogs who can show me and he thinks I would benefit from ongoing social settings like that.  My best friend is my foster dog sister, who is my same age (18 months). Even though I am shy and scared at first with humans, I absolutely love running around and wrestling with my foster sister and we are very active! We like to wrestle, run zoomies and play with our toys. I’m hoping to find a home with another active dog who wants to play with me and can help me get more confident and burn off energy. I love walks but they can also be kind of scary with noises and people, but it’s a bit easier when I’m walking with a dog friend. I still have a hard time feeling safe enough to stop and go potty on our walks but I’m pretty good with using the yard and we are working to help me not have accidents inside. Overall everyone tells me that I’m making great progress! I am still looking for that special family who has dog experience and is willing to put the time and resources into training and helping me learn to trust. Not to brag, but I promise I’m worth it! I give the best hound hugs and kisses and once I get to know you I love to snuggle! Be sure to follow my adventures on instagram: @senny_wise_and_hound_foolish",

Howlin4Spirit stepped up and took in 3 of her precious ones. CEASAR was outside in a fenced-in area withSnookie,a very sweet overweight female RottieX, whom he had the pleasure of keeping company and helped protect Miss Pat(single senior) from anyone trying to come onto her property while walking to shop at Walmart. While Sophie is rather BIG and can be a bit scary-looking to strangers. Cesar is neither scary nor aggressive, in any way. So, they made a good team. He gets along well with Howlin4Spirit's friendly and spirited 45+ dogs running freely on 5+ fenced-in acres, daily. He is a DEVOTED COMPANION. NOT to be mistaken for a 'yard ornament' nor laundry room occupant! He LOVES to be with his person, eat, sleep and follow his person around while doing all outdoor chores, laundry, cooking, taking walks in the woods, etc. He gets along well with other dogs and cats, but prefers being one of 1, 2 or 3, at most. He needs his person to take time to love on him, sit quietly with him in the woods on their morning walks and on the couch in the evenings.

Daisy does not attend every event but if you are interested, please ask for her foster contact info from your application processor to schedule a meet and greet or confirm event attendance. Thanks for checking Daisy out. 11/22/18. Daisy is still up for adoption. She has been in foster care (with the same foster) since Dec 2016. During that time she recieved care for her feet which have improved but are now at a standstill regarding healing. Daisy wants you to look past her feet and see what a wonderfully sweet and kind dog she is. She gets along with all dogs (large and small). Crate trained, housebroken, and very sweet. Doesnt mind kids as long as they arent jumping on her. She would prefer a quiet setting. She would be fine with mild exercise as she is very low key. Condo / townhome / apartment and smaller residential settings would be fine. She is estimated to be about 6-8 years old and is about 50 lbs. 5/4/18Daisy is still up for adoption. She is low key, sweet, kind, gentle with other dogs. She likes to lounge around the house. She is good with dogs, cats, kids, and is a gentle soul. her feet are looking much better and she has some fur regrowth on the feet now. She doesnt attend all event but if you are interested in her, please reach out to your app processor so a meet and greet can be scheduled. She is currently living with other dogs and is great w them. She is crate trained, housebroken in current foster home, and is quiet. She is a lovely dog. She would be fine w a renter / townhome / condo lifestyle and doesn't require much exercise. She is more outgoing than she used to be now that she is more comfortable. She is still shy at events. 8/4/17Daisy Em Society is still looking for her forever home. She is good w other dogs, good w cats, and fine around children. She has regained fur growth on most of her legs. Her foot is still weird. She will always have damage to the nail bed on the front and back affected foot. She is sweet, kind, and gentle. She is a little shy. She would do best in a home with other dogs. She likes to lounge around.2/22/17Daisy Em Society is a 5-7 year old treeing walker coonhound. She is 45 -50 lbs. She is good with other dogs, and is described as cat friendly as well. She was rescued from the woods of North Carolina by a caring animal lover but was found in very sad shape. She had wounds and scabs, was underweight, and two of her feet appeared to have a disfiguring infection of an unknown sorts (you can see this in the picture, it is her front right and back left foot). Daisy walks and runs on all four feet. Sometimes she picks her paw up when she stands (as pictured). This caring lady made sure Daisy saw the vet and was spayed but she couldn't do much more to help her and Daisy seemed very shy and nervous. She reached out to a rescue group that was able to take her and arranged for her transport to a foster home up north with Wags for her to get additional testing / care. Her foster home was known for taking shy and nervous hounds and was a great place for her to work on doggie socialization and trusting humans. Daisy has been in foster care for several months. She is more trusting with people (but is still a work in progress), she received wound care and skin testing, and she was treated for heartworms. Daisy is spayed. Daisy is currently being treated with an antifungal daily pill and has shown improvement on her affected feet. She has hair re-growth and improvement in her skin coloring. Daisy is now an appropriate weight and looks good. Her nails are still disfigured on the two affected feet and the damage is likely to be permanent. At this time, the vet is not recommending toenail removal. However, this may be a possibility or a need down the line. Daisy does NOT like her feet touched and is very uncomfortable with nail trimming. Her feet are probably still pretty sensitive. Amputation / foot removal is not recommended. The affected area has receded and is mostly concentrated on the paws now, instead of the leg. Daisy is good w other dogs and is becoming more social with people. Daisy walks well on a leash. Daisy doesn't like loud noises / street traffic. Daisy doesn't like to be startled. She would do best in a quiet home or a quieter environment. Daisy likes to be petted now and seeks attention on her terms. Her favorite thing to do it lounge around, whether it is in her crate or on the couch. She is very quiet and rarely barks. Occasionally she will snuggle on the couch. Mostly she just hangs out and you don't notice she is there. She is crate trained and housebroken in her current foster home.  Daisy likes to run and play outside but is very calm / quiet in the house. She has great house manners and doesn't get into anything. She is very quiet and mild mannered. Daisy is only impatient when it is dinner time. She has a good appetite and loves her meals. Daisy is low maintenance. Daisy would make a great pet for someone looking for a quiet dog.

Huey here. It’s been quite a six months for me. I arrived at rescue back in September 2018. I was at the county kill shelter during a time when the shelters in Atlanta were packed with dogs and cats from Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas. I was a senior and surrendered, and they knew that was very risky for me. Fortunately, GA JRT saw me and, having a big place in their hearts for sweet senior boys like me, they pulled me. Unfortunately, though, I was very sick.I was running a 103.6 fever, so they rushed me to the vet, where I almost collapsed. I was diagnosed with pneumonia, then ended up in and out of the hospital for several months with other respiratory issues. They tested me for various diseases because my liver enzymes were boosted, and I ended up on blood pressure meds … which worked wonders for me. Then I got sick again earlier this year. They took me to various vets; had multiple tests done. My bloodwork was “all kinda wonky,” but finally! They discovered what’s going on.I have Atypical Cushing’s Disease. It’s nothing really serious. I just kind of drink and pee a lot sometimes, but I’m on a couple of supplements (not even medication) now and I am back to being me! I’m at a healthy weight, my hair has grown back (except my tail; never gonna happen), and I am all Jack! I’m very focused, very smart, very frisky … and might I mention? Very handsome!So, if you’re looking for an older man who is laid-back but is still “all Jack” and loves to go for rides and walks, I’m your guy. Other dogs are fine with me, especially if they’re chill … and if they're girls. I tend to get along best with the girls. I’m around 7-8 years old (the gray beard is from a stressful former life) and a perfect pint-sized Jack about 15-16 lbs.For the very best response time, please visit http://bit.ly/2ML6d0TYou will need to copy and paste the link but it takes you directly to his information.Please note: We are a small volunteer run rescue.

Simba means powerful warrior, and his name certainly suits him.  Simba was pulled from a high kill shelter in North Carolina on his very last day.  Simba came to us emaciated and covered with horrible scars and bite wounds.  Everywhere on his poor, frail body had either scabs, open wounds or scars.  We estimate Simba to be around two years old and is a bully breed mix.  He is a big eater, but does not show any food aggression or guarding at all, which is amazing considering he was nearly starved to death.  Simba would benefit from some training, as he was never taught leash manners.  He has not shown any aggression toward other dogs or cats, although he will sometimes growl if he feels threatened by another dog so a very careful and proper introduction to any other dogs will be necessary.  Considering everything he has been through, we do not blame Simba one bit for his concerns.  Simba has a wonderful personality - he is very energetic and LOVES toys.  He loves to carry his blanket around and play with it.  He will play with basically anything he can find.  Simba loves people and will sit still and soak up all the love and attention you are willing to give him.  Simba is house and crate-trained, up to date on all shots, heartworm negative and on heartworm, flea and tick prevention.  Simba clearly had a really rough past and although his body will always likely bear the scars, he did not let his past form his personality.  \""Scars remind us of where we have been, but they do not have to dictate where we are going.”  And this is certainly true for Simba.  Please consider opening your heart and home to this sweet boy and finding out for yourself what an amazing boy he is – you won’t regret it!",

Little Ann would love for you to come visit her and maybe give her the forever home she needs. Come meet Lil Ann and the rest of the furry friends we have at Father Johns animal house.",

I rescued Bucky from a shelter in NC.  He's up to date on his shots, neutered, and heartworm neg and on prevention. He's a very friendly boy, very smart.  He rode pretty nicely with having a seat belt harness and tether on in the car.  He gives lots of kisses. I learned that Bucky has separation anxiety, I will try to use a crate to see how that goes, but he certainly can't be left alone at home, free to roam. This boy would make an AWESOME dog for someone who suffers from PTSD that needs a companion animal to take everywhere with them. He is smart, friendly, loves everyone and all dogs, he's just a great boy who needs some training, but I think he could pick things up quickly,  I'm asking $200.00 to adopt. His tail never stops wagging. Oh and he likes cats and kids too!!!!  If you'd like to adopt Bucky, please email me at ess4us@ptd.net or for more info call me at 570-773-3077. THANKS for looking!",

She's a sweet, middle aged girl of about 4 or 5 who is slow to warm up and enjoys  human companionship.  She's medium sized and weighs about 50-55 lbs, is spayed and vaccinated,  housebroken and crate trained, although she doesn't need to be crated.   Tina's issue is that,  sometime in her past, another dog or dogs weren't so nice to her and she is fearful.  Her defense is showing aggression towards other dogs.  She could successfully be walked on a leash in a park or neighborhood where there are other dogs,  and she walks very well on a leash,  but she will do best not having to closely interact with other dogs.  She,  therefore,  needs to be an only dog. She is a low-key, low maintenance  dog and will make her person or family very happy.  She also loves belly rubs!!

This sweet boy has seen some tough times but has come through and is doing great.  He was found as a stray nearly starved and no hair on his back. He had raw sores on his neck, head and back. It was also evident by his raw neck that  he had been kept on a chain. With the gracious help of a rescue and foster family, Baxter has made a tremendous recovery over the past 2 months.  He is LOVING dog life~ he plays like a puppy & loves his bone and toys. He gets along with our other dogs (took slow introductions and a little time). He also gets along with cats. Mostly just curious but doesn’t chase.Baxter is still somewhat fearful of the outdoors at times. He still gets skittish and nervous when on walks but is getting better over time.  He is also nervous around unfamiliar people. He will need a patient and loving person / family to help continue with his rehab and recovery. Most of his fur has grown back and he is looking so beautiful.He would do well with a home where someone is home during the day and he would also do better with a home that has  another furry dog companion. He is not aggressive but loves to run, play and engage in dog play. *We wouldn’t recommend Baxter go to a home with small children.

We immediately contacted Dog Wizard of Charlotte and enrolled Cali in a behavioral training program. She went with the trainer for 2 weeks and did really well. Cali has made great improvements and does well when we board her at pet paradise. She always receives positive report cards towards staff and other dogs.  Since then we have had a child. We have always been careful about their interactions together, constant supervision, no food or toys around her. We had a very scary incident last night where Cali growled at our 3 year old and tried to bite her after our daughter attempted to pet her back. We are heartbroken and don’t know what to do.

This little lady only has 3 legs, but don’t tell her that! She never lets that get in her way. She can go on walks and her previous owner even took her on a few hikes – with plenty of breaks when that back leg got tired. However, Arcadia will happily entertain herself with squeaky toys or an antler bone. If toys are present, she never puts any inappropriate household items in her mouth.She is house trained and a quick study with tricks and training. She knows basic house manners, can sit, lay down, and will even go to her crate on cue! She also has a solid “go to bed” behavior and will stay there even when her dinner is being served until she is released with an “okay.”Most of all, this little lady is a lover. She loves to cuddle and be near her person. Pets are awesome, but belly rubs are just the bees knees. She is sweet with small children and babies – who she loves to sniff and give kisses to. Arcadia would do best in a home without dogs or cats.Will you give this beautiful lady the chance she deserves?Reason for re-homing? I am selling my house and moving in to an apartment.

She will make a wonderful pet for a fun-loving, active owner.  She has so much to offer her humans. A fenced yard is a must with this girl. She loves her outdoor time and to explore.  It would be the best of both worlds!She is UTD on vaccines, heartworm negative, and spayed.  Unknown if cat friendly, but she did meet some young children and enjoyed them.If you would be interested in fostering Jackie, please email Valerie at valeriebond@hotmail.com.",

This middle age girl is so SWEEEET. She came from a shelter in Ohio. She was a medical mess and needed some extra TLC. We got her spayed, and removed a few tumor/mass cells on her body. One of the mass cells that removed from her leg, came back as a stage 2, and we were not able to get clean margins on that tumor. (the other tumors we did get clean margins on them). So this particular spot on her leg, will need to have a watchful eye on it. There is a chance it may come back. But we don't know if, and when it will She can still live a very long life, with a quality life. Also, we have discovered she may some have allergies, as she does chew on her feet on occasions. We also treated her infected ears and got that infection cleared up.Darci is about 5 years old. She is a beautiful white girl with a very loving personality. She loves all people and always wants to be with you. Whoever adopts her, will simple fall in love with this girl. She would love to be someone's lap dog and will follow you around the house, just to say HI and be your shadow. Once she warms up to people, she does like playing with toys. She is great with kids and has not shown much interest in cats. Bonus !!! She is good with other dogs, but can be food aggressive, only with other dogs. Not humans. So if you are looking to adopt her, and you do have another dog, you will need to feed the dogs in a separate room to keep things nice and quiet. She is crate trained, can hear, is housebroken and knows all her basic commands.With the potential of her one mass returning on her leg, her adoption fee will only be $100. But like it was mentioned, we simple do not have a crystal ball, to say if and when it will return. We just know this doll of a girl, will make anyone happy who has the desire to welcome her into their home.",

Their Mom asked that Buddy remain a resident of Canyon Pet Lodge and that we find new great homes for the kitties and Lady.  The kitties were rehomed through a wonderful cat rescue and are happy in their new homes.  Buddy will remain a resident of Canyon Pet Lodge  Lady has attended Camp Bark DayCamp daily since 2016.  She is excellent with all large breed dogs of all ages and both genders.  She is a \""test\"" dog because of her great temperament.  We do not recommend small dogs as Lady has a bit of prey drive.  She could live with a small dog companion with a savvy parent only.  She can live with cats, but be warned, she may chase them until she gets used to them.  Dominant cat companions would be best.  She is excellent with humans of all ages.

Originally from Oklahoma, currently living and a foster family in north western Pennsylvania, Jack has adjusted to the snow belt well. He can be tied out briefly to go potty and is not a barker.

He is just that wonderful...he turns heads wherever he goes, children flock to him and feed him snacks on the street, and he literally stops traffic (we are not exaggerating!).  He arrived in NYC from Oman in mid-April, and a full month later, we are still searching for his forever home.   Sid is athletic and energetic and would benefit from being a part of an active household.  He is easily trainable and highly intelligent, learning how to go off-leash in a matter of days after arriving in NYC.  He gets along very nicely with other dogs, and overcame a former fear of men, and gets along well with all humans.  Being from the desert, he never saw vegetation before and loves grass and flowers (and will also eat them with delight).  He is really the perfect dog--it pains us to give him up, but we must make room for other rescued dogs and give Sid a chance at a forever home.  Sid is the biggest of his litter, and at 5.5 months old as of mid- May 2019, he is already quite tall.  We anticipate that he will be around 52 -56 cm tall when he is full grown, so he's going to be a big boy.

About Treatment of Dogs in Oman:Police officers in Oman drive around and legally shoot dogs in packs as part of organized culling projects.  Those who are lucky enough to escape the firing squad are often killed when discovered, or killed by forced starvation by being brought to the middle of the desert and abandoned with no resources.  Dogs have zero rights there, and the kind humans who help them are few and far between. About the breed:The Omani Wadi dog is specific to Oman.  Originally descended from the Saluki, the breed eventually mixed with many other breeds, such as Canaan Dogs and other breeds of abandoned dogs, and is now its own unique type. This type of dog is extremely clever, loyal, and loving. The breed is also energetic, so they would do well with a family that has room for them to run and/or who will exercise them. Some of them can go on daily 6 mile runs and even further.  This is not to suggest that they are restless by default, but would probably do well with people who like to walk, run, or ride bikes. When socialized properly at an early age, they can get along with other dogs, cats and people, as well as animals like guinea pigs or even turtles.  The breed truly is limitless in its ability to adapt and learn new things.",

His entire family was shot by the police (that's how population control of dogs is done in Oman).  He was the only survivor.  He was rescued by a good samaritan and taken to the ER,  After some time in the ER he was well he was taken in by a volunteer rescue organization in Oman.  We partner with other rescues to help place dogs.  Snoopy is a very loving boy who unfortunately given the trauma he experienced at such a young age suffers from ptsd and some separation anxiety.  He gets along with most dogs, but gets overwhelmed in dog park situations or if there are too many dogs or people.  He would do best in a home (single family home) with a fully fenced in yard and a predictable routine.   He is a high energy pup who needs a spacious fenced in yard.  He loves to chase birds and squirrels for hours.  His favorite thing to do inside is to snuggle next to his human.   He is very affectionate.   Snoopy is around 30 lbs...he's 1.5 yrs old.  He is up to date on vaccines, preventatives, neutered and micro-chipped.  If you are interested in Snoopy,  please email Breshkie@dogworldrescue.com for more info.

He is very much a people person. He is well trained especially off leash. He’s getting better but still needs work on his leash walking. Harley is a professionally trained hunting dog but hasn’t hunted in a couple years. He is very good and responsive at recall. According to his previous owner he has a very good nose but is a bit unreliable at retrieving. He was trained to an electronic collar. He is crate trained, and has a travel crate that will come with him if you like. We are working on “sit” for his dinner bowl. He’s not perfect yet but most of the time he remembers without being told. Harley is house broken, never an accident. When I first got him he alerted at the door when he needed to go out. Once he learned the dog door he uses it whenever he needs to go out. He holds himself when he is in his create.Harley is ok with other dogs. He’ll stand his ground if there is an issue. He’s not really interested in other dogs, doesn’t really like to share his person with them, or play with them. He lived for 8 years as an only dog and would be best as an only dog. He has strong prey drive and would be best in a home without cats.Activity Level: Harley is very mellow and not high energy. He does like to explore and roll in the grass/dirt/leaves. He likes to go for walks and car rides. He is reported to love water. Someone who has room for a bit of romping and or swimming would be nice, or someone that will take him for hikes, walks or swimming would be nice.Fence: Harley will wander and hunt if not confined so a fence would be best. Harley is not a fence jumper, so a high block wall probably won’t be necessary.Behavior: Harley loves his people and will run to the neighbors to say hi. He likes to be hugged: no tensing up or wiggling for this guy he melts right into you without leaning all his weight on you. He loves to be petted and will climb into your lap now and again. He will be your shadow. He likes to be on the couch but hasn’t been allowed on the bed. He is not one to gaze deeply into your eyes but he is definitely affectionate. For some reason people like to hug him, and I’ve seen him get more kisses on the top of his head than any other dog. Even from people that I’ve never seen kiss a dog before. Just something about this gentle, mellow boy.Like all pups he has a couple of things that need more work: He likes to get tissues out of the bathroom trash and shred them. Now and again he will try and jump on you (getting much better there); now and again out of the blue he will counter surf. And he likes to go outside and bark at nothing in particular especially when I’m gone. I have been crating him when I leave, and is he very good with crating, but he might be best in a home where there is someone home most of the time. He does really well at being bathed, and having his ears flushed. He is a work in progress with teeth brushing.Medical History: Harley came to me with a chronic open wound. The wound was cultured and he had surgery.  That seems to be doing very well.He was very stiff and had trouble getting into the truck when he came to me. I have put him on some joint supplements and he is doing so much better. He isn’t as stiff and he is building up his muscles again. The best home for him would be with someone willing and capable of keeping him on the supplements.He came from Oregon and I was told that he didn’t have allergies; however, here we are just starting the allergy season and I’ve noticed that he seems to be licking his feet a lot. So he might have environmental seasonal allergies depending on where he lives.Foster Comments: Harley is so sweet and such a people oriented, mellow, gentle dog. He is easy to love and wants to please. He is well trained and generally very obedient. He is such a sweet boy. For the most part he needs just a bit of attention to a couple of training issues.Adoption Fee: $275.00",

Yep, that's right, 5 whole years hoping that some day I would get lucky and find a human of my own who will love me. I'm very active and playful and I bet I could be an agility star with how much I like to run and jump. Tennis balls are one of my favorite things along with getting attention from people I meet. I'm pretty smart and I know how to sit, go down and give paw. Comfy beds also make me happy but I would be the happiest if a human would stand in front of my kennel area and say...You're going home with me Jaxson!! Please visit me soon so I can know the feeling of a safe and loving home.

Majestic, grace, resilience, affectionate, calm, happy, loving, survivor, and feisty are just some of my descriptors.

I was left in the streets to fend for myself while dragging my legs until some kind people took me in and helped me heal. I am now ready to find my forever home where people will love me for how affectionate I am and not judge me based on how I look. I had a rough go of it but my resilience and will to live shine brighter than any diamond or star in the sky.

Therefore, it is very hard to know the exact breeds that make up each dog. We do our best in trying to be somewhat accurate, when choosing breeds, but is nearly impossible to know.When adopting a puppy, this plays a big part of the uncertainty of the size the puppy will end up being. *Just know, when raised with boundaries, consistency, effort, excercise, and love, your puppy will grow to be a HUGE source of UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, TOTAL LOYALTY, HAPPINESS, COMFORT AND COMPANIONSHIP....... REGARDLESS OF SIZE, no matter what!SOME HOME/RENTER INSURANCE PROVIDERS HAVE VERY STRICT POLICIES REGARDING WHICH TYPE OF DOG BREEDS ARE ALLOWED UNDER THEIR COVERAGE.

She is a 9 year old Lab/Rhodesian Ridgeback mix rescued from being locked in a hunting box (think rabbit hutch) in South Carolina with 3 other canine companions, one of which died before they could be rescued. Despite this horrid experience, she is the sweetest dog and loves all people. She has been thriving in foster care in Massachusetts and is ready for a home of her own. She loves & needs the company of other dogs and is wonderful with children. She is good but strong on the leash & needs a harness to keep her focused. She currently lives with multiple dogs and cats & gets along with all. She would be great in a home with children of any age & definitely needs a home with at least one other dog with a comparable activity level. Please consider opening your home to this girl who has been through so much while remaining so sweet. To adopt Roxie, please visit our website www.snarrnortheast.org and fill out an application.

She is an Aussie healer mix, is about 4 years old and only weighs 44lbs. She was rescued along with several others from a hoarding case in South Carolina. She is our staff favorite and all of the other dog’s favorite as well! She is so gentle and so sweet and is the most social and outgoing of the pack. Brenda shares her food, attention and time openly with everyone. We believe she is the mom to many of the other dogs and puppies that were on the property, due to her being the oldest female and to how they all take to her. Brenda deserves a loving home where she can be spoiled and fired on. A home with another dog is ideal because of where she came from.",

A good Samaritan had reported that they saw her lying in the grass on the side of her owners house, covered in fleas, and emaciated. Animal Control investigated and took her. Sookie is an 8 year old female Boxer blend. On intake, she was extremely underweight, and she has cataracts that make it difficult to see. It has been determined that she is also a diabetic, and a new family should know that she will require insulin as part of her daily care. In addition, Sookie had a small mass on her leg that was determined to be Mast Cell. She has had surgery with our vet to remove the mass and has healed wonderfully. She is now doing so great in her foster home but would really love a home to call her very own!Her foster Mom says she is the perfect mix of couch potatoe and playmate! Sookie is a vocal lady who definitely has her own hilarious personality to show you. When Sookie isn't curled up on your lap (Yes, ON your lap), in her bed, or on the floor next to you she is exploring her surroundings with her curious little nose or demanding your attention with her adorable little grumbles! To Sookie, there aren't too many things greater in life than cuddling with the nearest human or playing with a fun toy! Speaking of toys, Sookie loves a good game of tug-of-war or a round of squeaking her favorite squeaky toy. She also enjoys walks full of exploring and sniffing and is more than willing to accompany you on an easy hike with some more leash training.Sookie is very tolerant of all kinds of petting, even some attention that might annoy some dogs. She does occasionally play a little rough so, supervision around the little ones is never a bad idea. She reallyenjoys interacting with other dogs, especially those who want to play with her. Once introductions are done she is happy to play with her canine buddy or simply relax on the couch next to them.Sookie has what some consider a complicated relationship with cats. She desperately wants to play with them but in true Boxer form, she doesn't seem to understand that hissing and swatting isn't playing. A kitty that loves playtime as much as her would be a dream come true to Sookie.Sookie has made huge strides in her leash walking but, her cataracts do inhibither vision somewhat so unexpected objects in her path may trip her up.In other areas she is a lady. She waits patiently (with the exception of a few grumbles) for her food and allows you to take it away with nothing worse than a pout. She is a pro at receiving her insulin and acts as if she doesn't even know you're there when administering it.She really is the full package and any family would be VERY lucky to call her their own.Sookie is up to date on shots and will be spayed prior to placement in her forever home.

He obviously suffered from a life of neglect for too long. This is so unnecessary & so unfair for any dog to have to endure such abuse.

Leo is eager to please and loves his \""person\"" dearly. He is quite good at snuggling and loves to be touching his person or another pup while napping. He can be a little hyper-reactive to stimuli, as most puppies are, but once he settles down he is the most mellow sweet and loving dog ever. He is wonderful with everyone including kids, other dogs, and even cats! He has made such a remarkable physical transformation and it seems that his terrible beginnings in life just made him the most grateful, appreciative and most loving dog he is today.Leo knows sit, down, come, leave it and walks well on a leash and is also crate trained.He will be neutered and up to date on vaccines prior to placement in his forever home.

When Bobby went into our care he was shut down and withdrawn.  Through time, patience and lots of love from his foster family, he has emerged a happy, friendly and playful guy.  His little nubbie tail wags, wags, wags when he greets you at the door.  Bobby’s breed is anyone’s guess.  He looks like he has some collie in him, and maybe a little lab.  We do not guarantee any breed mix/combo.   Bobby is approximately 5 years old, is 57 pounds and is housetrained. Bobby has transformed into a playful, cuddly, loving dog who is usually touching, leaning against, or curled up with you during downtime.  He loves, loves, loves the water.  He’ll play in hoses and irrigation systems, so he’s a lot of fun when you’re washing your car.  Bobby has been for a few boat rides and will get into the water freestyle when stopped at the favorite swimming hole.  He gets excited at just the sight of water and gives you no trouble when it’s bath time!  Bobby knows his basic manners and commands, and likes pleasing you and getting treats.  His favorite treat is Redi-Whip straight from the can!  He is a stuffed toy dog and will self-entertain by throwing around stuffed toys, which occasionally end up getting tossed onto countertops!  He likes to play tug-of-war and will do zoomies in the yard when he’s got a toy in his mouth.  Bobby enjoys walks, and is great in the car.  He’s just an all-around outdoor enthusiast, and we would love to see him adopted to people who will take him on outdoor adventures.  Bobby will need a little time readjusting to his forever home, so we are looking for a patient adopter who will commit time to training so he continues his transformation.  Bobby gets along great with other dogs and he is also great with cats.  He will actually snuggle up with his foster family’s cat from time to time.  He would do fine as the only dog in the home or with other animals.   Bobby has been fully vetted, is heartworm negative and is up to date on all vaccines.  He is neutered, microchipped, and on current heartworm prevention and flea prevention. Bobby does have a back leg that ever so slightly curves inwards.  The vet checked him out and said it’s fine.

My name is Blanche and I am an adorable gal that is looking for my new family.  I was found as a stray and rescued from a shelter in South Carolina in February.  I spent 2 months in a foster home before coming to Penny Angels.  My foster mom gave me lots of love (and plenty of good food), and when I was ready to travel to New Jersey, she sent me on my way with many hugs and kisses.I am approx. 9 years old and weigh 24 lbs.  You might think of me as a ‘senior’ because of my age, but I’m not a big fan of ‘labels’.  If you feel the need to label me, though, I prefer to think of myself as ‘nicely seasoned’.  Ahh… nicely seasoned has a much nicer ring to it (and it sounds yummy, too)!  I am a very sweet & laid-back gal.  When you meet me, you will fall in love with me.  Do you see that smile on my face?  Happy girl- yep, that’s me!  I try not to let things bother me.  I spent time with the volunteers on Saturday at PetSmart and they all thought I was a special girl.Are you looking for a calm beagle?  We can cuddle together and watch tv, or I can keep you company while you prepare your home for the Summer months.  I like spending time outside soaking up the sunshine and fresh air.  I get along well with other dogs and love to play with them!  I will snuggle up to my doggie friends, too, and will sometimes use the warmth from their bodies to keep me comfortable.  How can you resist my cuteness?I will be at Petsmart in Mays Landing, NJ on Saturday from 11-3 pm.  Will you be waiting for me?

He's gets along great with people.  Buster is BTN's poster child for happiness.  He loves life and is thrilled just to have a bed, food and somewhere warm to stay.

My name is Tessie. I am a 33lb three year-old female Pointer-mix. And, I am spayed, vaccinated and micro-chipped. I was rescued from a shelter in South Carolina. I was pregnant and I tested positive for heartworm. After my four puppies were born, I began heartworm treatment. I had to remain quiet and calm during my treatment. As you can imagine, it was BORING resting inside, day after day. Thankfully, my treatment is complete. I will need to take heartworm preventative monthly and be retested in 6-months. I am housetrained and trusted with free roam of the home. I am nearly crate trained and learning how to walk on leash wearing a slip-lead. I know “Sit,” best. I sit before meals and I sit to have my leash put on. I also come when my name is called. I am a Pointer, which is a type of a hound dog. Hounds were bred to help people with hunting. As a hound, I am very good at communicating. I will let my people know when visitors arrive or when I see a deer. When I see a bird or a deer outside, I point at them with my nose and tail aligned. I perk up when I hear wild geese. I love being outside, especially on warm sunny days. I love the smells, the sights and the sounds. I am happy in the fenced yard and I love to take walks. My foster family has several dogs and I am friendly with everyone. I even try to initiate play with some of them. I enjoy snuggling on the couch with my people and the rest of the dogs. They don’t have cats, but I met one when I was at the veterinary office, and I was told that I was good. Sometimes, their grandchildren visit. I like them. They are two and four years old, and I am three years old. I think it would be nice to live with children all the time. I am affectionate, eager-to-please, joyful and playful. Future family, I can hardly wait to meet you!To adopt, please submit an application at this link: http://form.jotform.com/form/11880935459 or visit www.pottersangelsrescue.org to view additional adoptable dogs and for more information.

Her puppies have gone on to their new lives, and now it's Bitzy's turn to find a new loving home. Behaviorally, Bitzy is a somewhat of a Special Needs dog -- she'll need an owner willing to visit her in the shelter multiple times before taking her home, and someone who understands that Bitzy will never be the dog who has an active social life, with humans or other dogs. She does enjoy other dogs, and would probably do best if she could live with another dog, but she is not the kind of dog who would ever go to the dog park. Once she knows you, she's happy to snuggle and get belly rubs, but it takes a LONG time for her to feel that comfortable. Bitzy needs a home with a fenced-in yard; we have worked hard to desensitize her to the leash, but she's not there yet. She's fearful of the leash, even when it's not clipped on, and once she has it on, she wants to go the other way. We are able to get her from her kennel to our yard without a leash, so a home set up with that arrangement would be great. In the yard, she sniffs around, and even gets the zoomies, especially when playing with another dog. She likes toys, but mostly just to gather around herself -- she doesn't know how to play with toys yet.Bitzy's ideal adopter would be someone with extreme patience, a gentle, caring soul, and a willingness to learn how to help fearful dogs, plus has a fenced-in yard and another dog for her to play with. Her $350 adoption fee includes a consult with one of our trainers.",

Often she’ll thank you for the head pets with kind, sweet kisses.Clover is house and crate trained and likes her walks and play time with other dogs in the neighborhood. The foster thinks she’d do best with another dog in the house. Being young, she is learning what she is allowed to chew & what not to nosh on. She is crated when the family is out of the house & adores her stuffed marrow bones or Kongs & nylabones.Clover heads north in 2 weeks so please arrange a meet & greet to see her.

When you meet Lady it is obvious that she did at one time have a home where someone taught her the commands that she knows and how to play her favorite game of “fetch”.Lady has been in foster since 1/7/18. She has been a perfect houseguest, is completely house and crate trained. She goes right into her crate every morning when I leave for work and is sleeping when I get home. Lady loves her person, loves cuddling and to be pet. She is a calm dog that loves her toys and a good nap on the couch. On walks she doesn't pay attention to other dogs and walks calmly next to them when on pack walks. We do not know much about Lady’s past, but she does scare easily, so she would do best in a calm household with older, respectful children, and not much traffic in and out of the house. She takes a while to warm up to new people but once she does she loves you. Lady is a very special girl that deserves a loving home of her own. She is silly, full of personality and one the sweetest dogs I've ever had the pleasure of fostering. She is so easy to love and will make a wonderful addition to the right household.If you want to meet Lady go to EHRDOGS.ORG and submit an application. Don't forget to ask for LADY BEAUFORT - she is waiting so patiently at the kennel for someone to fall in love with her and bring her home. Could that someone be you?",

Walnut and her puppies were rescued from a high kill shelter in South Korea. We are so excited to share about Walnut because Walnut’s son Alvin came to US and found his forever loving home and is just loving his new life. We would like to provide a loving home for Walnut as well that she so deserves. **Foster Update: Walnut is loving her life in the states. Foster mom says she is adjusting really well. She is very quiet, affectionate and fully potty trained! Now, things could change with new environment, but we are told she is all around an awesome gal. Walnut does get a bit afraid of other furry ones and would be best at a home as an only dog. Walnut was born with Microphthalmia, under developed right eye but does not require any other medical attention for it. We are told Walnut is a is a very sweet dog, but just because she is a mixed breed and slightly different, noone welcomed her as a family in Korea.  She still needs lots of human touch and interaction with people until she feels more comfortable with her human companion, but other than that, she received a clean bill of health from the vet, and she is ready to be adopted!We believe people who adopt rescue animals because they are willing to accept a bit of imperfection, and willing to embrace, work/ train and love them no matter what baggage the animal had in the past. It can be challenging, but extremely rewarding. We have seen amazing transformation in our adopted dogs who have been with loving families, and it is our goal to provide all of them with the opportunity. We are at our happiest when we see photos of our adopted animals smile with the new adoptive family, and we hope to find Walnut a loving family who would do the same.  Please consider adopting Walnut and making her part of your family! If you would like to apply to adopt Walnut you can download an application here:  https://forms.gle/kBVSZ1kkmTgkhpBC6   You can MEET Walnut upon request or at one of our adoption event in the near future.  We will post the exact date once we finalize the plan.

He was rescued by another organization and adopted, but the adopted family lived in the countryside and left Ray tied up outside. Our  team in Korea stepped back in and took Ray back.

Right now, Ray is doing amazing and has many friends at the training facility! He loves the people there and enjoys sun bathing with the other puppies. He is great with people and loves other dogs.

Applicants must be at least 24 years old. ***If you would like to adopt them, please fill out our online application at https://sites.google.com/view/donghaepaws/. An HDP volunteer will reach out for more information after a careful review of your application. Please understand this may take few days. Thank you! Prior to rescue, many of our dogs have experienced minimal socialization and it takes time for them to learn about life as a family pet. Common skills such as house training and leash walking may often take a little extra time. Patience, understanding and a gentle hand are a must. The great news is, most of these dogs come around rather quickly and being a part of their rehabilitation is an extremely rewarding experience.We typically do not adopt to homes with children under 8 years old. A home check is mandatory before adoption. *** About us ***Hope For Donghae Paws(HDP) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) public charity dedicated to bringing rescue dogs from Korea to the US and finding permanent homes for them. It is true there are many animal lovers in Korea, but still many dogs suffer and are killed for food.Our mission is to find US homes for mixed-breed dogs whose chances of being adopted in their native Korea are very low.Find more about us on Facebook and Instagram!https://www.facebook.com/donghaepaws/https://www.instagram.com/donghaepaws/",

(Fortunately, this dog meat farm has since closed and been converted into a vegetable and chili farm!) Faith is loving life in Virginia! While she is still learning to trust, she is slowly blossoming into a smart playful pup with the help of her behavior trainer friends and the staff and volunteers who love her. She would likely do best in a quiet home with another dog to be her best buddy and show her the way. Faith still has a long road ahead as she learns to trust people, but we think she will be a wonderful fit for a calm family who is willing to go on this special journey with her.*I'M AVAILABLE FROM A FOSTER HOME!* Please call 703-746-4774 or email adoptions@alexandriaanimals.org for more information or to schedule a time to visit me!",

I like how theybounceand roll and I chase them all over and sometimes I give them back to my foster mom and she throws them again! I like people, if they are not wearing hats. I like to play with submissive dogs, but I prefer to be humans. No kitties for me though. I kind of act tough, but sometimes like to push my head lightly into your chest for comfort.

She currently weighs 44 pounds (as of 5/4/2019) and is fully-grown.  Ella’s rescued story:When Ella was few weeks old, she and the other two black puppies were brought into a sugar factory by the labors to watch the site.  A year later, the factory was shut down, Ella and the other two dogs were abandoned and became strays.   Luckily, some of city farmers in that area were very friendly to them and fed them regularly except for the owner of the farm threatened to take Ella and other dogs to the shelter.Since being raised by the people, Ella likes to hang out with those farmers; especially there was a farmer who brought treats for Ella every time when she visited.  Surprisingly, Ella always carried a “gift” for this farmer when she saw her; the gift could be a piece of banana tree bark, coconut tree bark, a small fragrant magnolia flower or a dry leaf.  The farmer said even those gifts were not valuable in many people’s eyes, they were the most special gifts to her; she has kept every piece of them.  One day, Ella’s left front leg was brutally broken by the farm owner with a thick stick when she was begging for the food, but none of those farmer could afford to take Ella for a surgery.  Although Ella’s broken leg had healed afterwards but she started to lame heavily.  Ella’s tough life did not end after this injury.  Few weeks later in a cold winter, Ella gave birth to seven puppies, but in a week, two of puppies were stolen by some foreign labors living in that area for meat.  Farmers immediately relocated and adopted out the rest of five puppies, but they could not protect Ella from being abused by some other farmers who did not like dogs.  Every time they found new cuts or open wounds on Ella’s body; they saw some farmers hit Ella with stones or broom sticks several times.  The place where Ella had grown became dangerous to her, the farmers worried that Ella would be the next dog meat to those foreign labors soon.  The farmer who received the gifts from Ella posted Ella’s story on her face book for help that has touched and shared by thousands of people and was reported by a television station.  Ella became an internet celebrity in Taiwan overnight and many people wanted to adopt her but nobody wanted to spend money fixing her injured leg; they only fancied her fame.  Ella’s completed medical information:When our organization decided to rescue Ella, we already understood that it would cost a fortune to get her broken leg fixed.  In last July in 2018, Ella had received a closing wedge osteotomy for her deformity broken leg from the best orthopedic doctor in Taiwan; it is one of the most complicated and expensive surgeries that dogs can have.  Fortunately, Ella’s leg has been healing very well after surgery.  She does not need special cares and is able to do all activities as other dogs can do and is pain-free for these activities.  She can run and play with other dogs but should be avoided fetching.  Ella should not be the candidate for daily running or jogging either; hiking, swimming and walking are all good exercises for her. Ella has passed the following medical tests: distemper test, 4 Idexx (Heartworm, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma Phagocytophilum), CBC, Biochemistry blood work and a PCR test.  She had teeth cleaned and also had x-rays on her hips; she does not have hip dysplasia. Ella is spayed, de-wormed, up to date on all vaccinations including rabies shot.  She is heartworm negative and on preventative treatment and is micro chipped.  All Ella's medical documents including the x-rays films on her hips and both pre- and post- surgeries will be given to her adopter when she is adopted. Ella’s temperaments and personality:Ella has been living with a foster family with many other dogs together.  Her foster parents run a dog training school, Ella gets chances to meet different dogs and dog owners; she gets along with the dogs and is friendly to the visitors.  Ella is especially gentle to the puppies; she has developed a special bond with a blind black puppy there.  Those puppies might remind Ella of the puppies she had once.  Ella had lived with the other family for three months with some dogs and a dog-friendly but dominant cat “Professor”.  Ella was very curious about the cats in the beginning; she tried to chase Professor and stray cats whenever she saw them.  Until one day, Professor hissed at Ella and scared her, Ella started to stay away from the cats.  The foster mom said that she believes Ella can live with cats as long as her new parents introduce her to the cat properly. Like other Pointers, Ella still carries the instinct of hunting.  Her current foster mom also a dog trainer said that when Ella spots birds, she would point by stopping and aiming its muzzle towards the birds and spend a lot of time waiting for a good chance to catch them, but she has not successfully caught anything yet.Ella’s both foster parents agreed that Ella is a very smart dog and sometimes is stubborn; she would try to test her owner’s limit.  She needs experienced dog owners who can give her commands firmly and make sure that she follows through; otherwise, she would think that she could get away with it.  She will be good for moderately active family with older children above 12 years old who are also familiar with dogs.   Ella is not passionate nor shy towards the strangers.  When she arrives a new environment, she needs 10-20 minutes to warm up.  Ella is more friendly when she meets strangers outside the house and then slowly introduce the strangers into the house.  Ella is very sweet and submissive to her care takers.  Ella LOVES food and does not waste any food at all; she usually cleans up the food dropped by other dogs on the floor.  Ella is not food or toys aggression or possession toward people.Ella does not like to get wet, so she does not like to go out in the rain.  She is not afraid of thunder or fireworks and does not have separation anxiety either.   She does not chew furniture and enjoys playing toys by herself if no any other dogs play with her, her favorite toys are stuffed animals. Ella is house broken and likes to do her business on the grass but she prefers to use the bathroom off leash; otherwise, she would need a long walk before doing her business.  Ella will do better with a house with fully enclosed fenced in yard; an apartment setting or people sharing living space with roommates will not work for her.Ella loves car rides and does well in the car.  She is not energetic but likes to run with other dogs.  We hope Ella’s parents can include her in your daily activities to take her for outings, short trips or visiting friends except for daily neighbors walk or playing in the yard.  We really want Ella to have the opportunities to experience different parts of her life that she had missed before.  Where is Ella and how to meet her?Ella is still in Taiwan.  If you are seriously thinking of giving Ella a loving permanent home, please contact us to ask for an adoption application.  Because we do not have a shelter to show people our rescues and all of our dogs are living with our foster family, we do not accept stop-by visits if you are interested in seeing our dogs.

44567530,https://www.petfinder.com/dog/benson-44567530/de/wilmington/hopeful-hearts-dog-rescue-de48/?referrer_id=87b31e7d-4508-41d1-95ff-fdb59b9d4669,Wilmington,Delaware,Taiwan,"Benson is a 17-month-old Scottish Terrier, Corgi and Formosan Mountain Dog Mix from the country of Taiwan.  He currently weighs 58 pounds (as of 4/28/2018) and is fully grown. Benson’s rescued story and completed medical information:In last March, Benson and his other three brothers at age 4 months old were rescued together from a huge cemetery area in the Central Taiwan where many people dump their unwanted dogs that became strays.  Benson’s three brothers all look like Corgi or Scottish Terrier Mix, and Benson is the only one has short hair and long legs, but he has the best temperament than his brothers.Luckily, Benson was a healthy puppy except for underweight.  He has received the following medical tests and an x-ray on his hips and joints as a routine exam: Distemper test, 4 Idexx (Heartworm, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma Phagocytophilum), CBC, Biochemistry blood work, and a PCR test for diseases and infections transmitted by fleas or ticks.  Benson was negative on all diseases and infections and does not have hip dysplasia either.  He will have his teeth cleaned before coming to the US for adoption.Benson is neutered, de-wormed, up to date on all vaccinations including rabies shot. He is heartworm negative and on preventative treatment and is micro chipped.  All Benson's medical documents including x-rays films on his hips will be given to his adopter when he is adopted. Benson’s temperaments and personality:Benson has been living with a foster family with their three dog-friendly cats and some other dogs of different sizes together.  He gets along very well with both dogs and cats, and he is a Gentle Giant in their eyes.  Benson is the target of being chased by a group of dogs while playing; when they are sleeping, Benson becomes their pillow.Benson loves people and is very submissive to his caregivers, but he is quite shy to the strangers.  The foster mom said that Benson usually hides when people come visit her; she leashes Benson out to introduce people to him and then Benson would be fine and want to be pet after a few minutes of meeting them.  Therefore, Benson would appreciate patient and experienced owners who are familiar and understand his shyness and give him 2-3 days to warm up.  After Benson feels comfortable with the new environment, he is a calm and affectionate dog that often wants to cuddle.  His foster mom said Benson is a very quiet but sweet companion; he is her shadow and quietly follows her wherever she goes.  Every time when she turns around, Benson is always next to her and wants to be pet and hugged.The foster mom has two older children at age 9 and 10.  They have never been scared by Benson’s large size, but Benson to them is more easygoing than many of other their foster dogs are.  They walk Benson on leash very often and Benson is always gentle and well behaved while being out with them.  Benson is not food or toys aggression or possession toward people and dogs; he does not mind that his food or toys being taken away.  His foster mom said that if any dogs want his toy, he would drop it and let them take it.Benson is young but is not energetic nor needs some heavy outdoor activities; he is laid back.  He will be good for moderately active family that has children older than 7 years old.  We do not think that Benson will do well with retired senior citizens since he still needs various activities than daily walks.  A house with physical fence will be great for Benson; we do not prefer to place him to an apartment/condo setting or sharing living space with roommates.Benson is house broken and rarely barks.  Although he is big, but he is very mellow and is not the candidate for watching the house because he may hide when he sees somebody breaking into the house.  Benson loves car rides and does well in the car; he also walks very well on leash.  We are looking for the family that like to include Benson in your daily activities to take him for outings, one-day trips or vacations except for daily neighborhood walks or playing in the backyard.Where is Benson?Benson is currently in Taiwan and will be scheduled to the US after we find a promised family for him, and he will be staying in North Wilmington in Delaware after his arrival.  If you are seriously thinking of giving Benson a loving permanent home, please email us for an application.  Because we do not have a shelter to show people our dogs and all our rescues live with our foster family, we do not accept stop-by visits if you are interested in seeing our dogs.

He currently weighs 41 pounds (as of 4/9/2019) and is estimated to be under 45 pounds when is fully grown.  Burger’s rescued story:Burger was rescued at a fishing port in Southern Taiwan in last August.  His rescuer took her 7-year-old daughter to visit the fishing port where a puppy happily ran to them from the distance, he was very passionate and wanted to play.  The rescuer did not rescue Burger right away because her hands were full at that time; she has many rescued dogs that were still waiting for homes.  But after returning home, she could not stop worrying about Burger's safety as he was so friendly to strangers.  That fishing port was one of dangerous places for strays in Taiwan, every year many strays disappeared overnight from being illegally caught and eaten by some foreign workers living in that area.  Two days after seeing Burger, the rescuer decided to re-visit the fishing port to rescue Burger.   Luckily, Burger was still there and still ran to them passionately when he saw them as he just saw his old friends.   Burger’s completed medical information:Burger is a healthy young dog, he has done the following medical tests after being rescued:  Distemper test, 4 Idexx (Heartworm, Lyme, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma Phagocytophilum), CBC, Biochemistry blood work, and a PCR test for diseases and infections transmitted by fleas or ticks.  He was negative on all diseases and infections and does not have hip dysplasia. Burger is neutered, de-wormed, up to date on all vaccinations including a rabies shot.  He is heartworm negative and on preventative treatment and is micro chipped.  All of Burger's medical documents including X-rays films on his hips will be given to his adopter when he is adopted. Burger's temperaments and personality:Burger is house broken, gets along very well with dogs, cats and children; one of his good friends in his foster home is a cat.  Burger is a gentle young dog with a very mellow disposition and is not hyperactive.  He is not shy but quite affectionate and super friendly to the strangers.  Burger likes children.  His foster mom in Taiwan has two children at the age of 10 and 11, Burger gets along very well with them and is their good friend; they usually leash Burger for night walks and watch television together.  Burger does not have separation anxiety and is not food or toy aggressive or possessive toward both people and dogs.   Burger loves food; sometimes he is a counter-surfer and steals his foster mom's breakfast from the table.  He also loves water.  The foster mom said that every time after heavily rain, Burger loves to go to the yard and never missed playing in the puddles to get himself wet.  He loves playing toys as well and especially likes stuffed animals, rope and tug toys and big dental bones.  If nobody plays with Burger, he would carry a toy or dental bone to his bed and quietly chew it by himself.  He also likes to play with toys for a while before sleeping.Burger has a very funny personality; his foster mom jokingly said that Burger should compete in the Academy Awards for best actor.  One day Burger bumped into a tree trunk while running and chasing with other dogs, he cried entire day and lift his paw several times to show his foster mom that he was hurt.  But the following morning, Burger already started to play with a group of dogs in the yard and did not seem to be bothered by the paw hurt from yesterday; however, when he saw the foster mom giving the treats, he suddenly went to lie on the couch and lift his paw again while quietly whimpering to get attention.    Burger loves to go for rides; he is well-behaved and quiet in the car.  He walks very well on leash.  He rarely barks except for playing and exciting so he would not be a good guard dog because he does not bark at strangers.Burger loves to run with other dogs in the yard; we do not think that he will do well in apartment.  We prefer the family that has a fully enclosed fenced in yard and do not prefer apartment setting or people sharing living space with roommates.Burger will be great for moderately active family with older children at 7-year-old and up.  We hope Burger’s parents can include him in your daily activities; for example, taking him for outings, short trips or visiting friends except for daily neighborhood walks or playing in the yard.  We really like Burger to have the opportunities to experience different parts of his life that he can enjoy.  Where is Burger and how to meet him?Burger has arrived in the USA on April 9 in 2019, and is currently staying with our foster family in North Wilmington in Delaware.  If you are seriously thinking of giving Burger a loving permanent home, please contact us to ask for an adoption application.  Because we do not have a shelter to show people our rescues and all our dogs are living with our foster family, we do not accept stop-by visits if you are interested in seeing our dogs.  Before meeting Burger, the prospective adopter needs to fill out the application and be approved. More videos of Burger are as follow: 1.

He is just 6 months old, 20 lbs but will grow to medium plus in size. He is a Formosan mix (or Taiwanese Mountain Dog), a breed that is not found commonly in our area (The Formosan breed is not listed in our database so we had to list her as a lab mix type).Gordon is Godiva's brother, who we also have rescued. Gordon is so friendly with people, gentle with children, and good with dogs of all sizes. He even likes cats!He has so much love to give and in her foster home is learning quickly things like leash walking, crate training, etc. He loves to ride in cars.He will make a great family dog. Formosans tend to be on the skittish side and can be timid in loud and chaotic places. Gordon will need gentle socialization to get used to busy streets, cars zooming by etc. He will do best in a home with another dog, as this will help him feel less timid.He has been rescued from Taiwan. He and his seven siblings were found abandoned in a ditch left to die, freezing and starving to death. So glad their future will be in loving homes with warmth, fun, exercise and yummy food.Gordon is updated on all shots, neutered and chipped. His adoption fee is $495, a small part of which helps us slightly absorb some of his transport.You can watch Gordon and his siblings on video here:https://youtu.be/xM3hO2Wz3Qw - G pupshttps://youtu.be/DZPuwPrHOBA - G pups looking for homeshttps://youtu.be/14Wk-zxPGW4 - G puppies - March 2019 – Dog ParkWe cover the medical to prepare the pet for adoption and the adopt donations go directly to cover those costs and range from $295-$495.

Please help us make that a reality.Why she is the way she is:  Felicia was rescued from a dog fighting operation in Tennessee.  She was extremely malnourished and emaciated and lived at the end of a massive, heavy chain for years.  She had a very serious tick borne blood disease called babesia at the time but she has been treated for that and is now clear of it.  Her teeth had been filed down to the roots because she was used for breeding and this prevented her from injuring the other dog.  Our vet removed the ones that were badly damaged and infected, so sometimes her tongue hangs out.  We think it just adds to her charm.If you, or someone you know, are interested in adopting or fostering, please visit our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or send us an email at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org",

This adorable lab puppy was surrendered to the local city shelter with her four siblings when she was only 8-9 weeks old. After a few days at the shelter, one of the staff members thought they looked sick, so she did a parvo test, and they all came back positive! The shelter sent a plea out, begging for rescues to save these puppies and take them through the very expensive parvo treatment. We rescued all five, took them to the emergency vet, and after 3 days there, discovered the test was a false positive and that none of them actually had parvo! What a relief!Ette and her sister Linda went into a foster home together and are adorable, playful, typical lab girls. They are shy around new people, and they love being outside, but after a few minutes, they warm right up and are ready to play! We think Ette would do fine in a home as an only dog, but of course would prefer that she have a canine companion to keep her company and be her best friend. Ette loves dogs of all sizes, would probably not mind cats, even though she hasn't been in a home with them, and she adores kids!Ette is spayed, up to date on her shots, and house broken. She sleeps in a kennel with her sister when her foster family is at work, and loves toys and bones to entertain herself with! Ette is good on a leash, great in the car, and has a happy, typical, goofy lab personality.

While our volunteers try to answer all emails/questions as quickly as possible, below please find answers to some of our most frequently asked questions. We ask that you please read these FAQ's to see if your question has already been answered before emailing additional questions:- If a dog or puppy is listed on Petfinder, they are still available. Please do not email asking if they are still available. If a dog or puppy is still listed, then we are still accepting applications :-) We do not go on a first come first serve basis, but on best fit for the family and most importantly, the puppy or dog.- We are taking our best guess on breed and size when fully-grown (or already an adult), based on the puppy's/dog’s physical appearance and what we might have learned about one or both parents depending on the situation. We rarely are able to tell the true or full breed mix of dogs as our information is limited most of the time. - Currently we do not have a physical shelter to visit our animals. Our expected opening will be in February-March 2019. Our dogs/puppies are either in foster care or are adopted straight from transport. An application is necessary to meet any dog/puppy. Often, dogs and puppies are spoken for before they arrive. Many people feel more comfortable with a meet and greet which we completely understand and respect, however please know you are taking a chance of that puppy/dog getting adopted by someone else before hand.- The way to start the process for any dog or puppy is by filling out an application. Applications for foster or adoption can be found at www.snarrnortheast.org and by clicking either adopt or foster from the main menu. If you fill out an application, please make sure you answer all the questions in as much detail as possible and that you receive a confirmation email, otherwise we did NOT receive it.",

Cat Friendly - YesKid Friendly - YesDog Friendly - Yes House Broken - YesCrate Trained - YesPretty Much Perfect - YesHello, my name is as you know is Georgia and as you can see from my picture, I am a Hound - Great Dane dog mixed, but mostly, I am all Hound Dog and my temperament is that of a hound dog. I am a very energetic dog with lots of energy and please  know that  I  get along  with my fellow dogs here and I am also \""Very Cat Friendly!\"" If you don't mind, I would like to  tell  you a few things about myself so that you aren't having to worry about what has been going on within my past history because always is there a history with us to which needs to be known and understood to which are things that have molded and shaped our lives and behavior.  I  was not a dog that was running around on the streets, but actually, I was living within  a nice home  with a very loving owner; but I am sorry to say that I had some bad  habits to  which she couldn't  deal with and it pained it her to have to surrender me to this Wags org. but for what were or are the problems that I was having, wasn't something that she could deal and put with.Before I talk about what all is good with me, let me talk about the  problems in  which  I  was having, so that you will know as to what all it is that I  am  working  on here  at \""Camp Chester\"" The problem that I was having was that  I  was relieving  myself  within my  kennel, but in and  to my defense, I wasn't being let out enough time and when people keep you locked  within  your kennel all day, its hard holding in  what is trying  to come  out. I know that this  was wrong, but  I am only a dog and after a while, I got so use to doing my business  within my  crate that  I had gotten use to going in there. I am also a dog  that has a nose and  I love to  explore things around the house and that at times, had gotten  me  into trouble  a little bit because  my  nose  often  lead me to the trash can. @Now those two things  were the  only things really wrong  with me.  I mean,  you cannot  fault me or hold it against me if I am a dog that is loving too hard or too much now can you? If  you can and do, then I guess that you can add that to the list of  things that  I need  to  work on. But if loving people is a crime, then I am guilty and you can throw away the key. But know that I amnow at \""Camp Chester\"" and I am working with a very good trainer and he has promised me that by the time that I graduate from here, I will be a dog with valuable obedient skills and ever problem that I had within my past, will be just that, left in the past. One thing that he told me, that for every dog that he has ever worked with, was dogs in which people loved and had gotten adopted and he says, that he sees something very special within me that others will as well.Please know that I have no aggressive issues whatsoever and  I am a very  people's  friendly dog that loves to be with my owner spending time with them sitting and watching television or just chilling out on the porch.  I  am not a dog  that loves to bark, I am a very quiet dog  who is laid back, until you are taking me out to the park, pool or wherever. I am learning how to play catch  and return with a Frisbee and let me  tell  you that this is a whole lot of  fun  for me  and  my trainer. I got a lot to work on, but I am hoping that by the  time that  I leave  from  here, my skills will be that of other dogs within this sport. Hey, did I mentioned that I will be able to read  your hand sign language signals? My trainer is and has been teaching with nothing but nonverbal commands and using all hand signals. I am doing very well with this. So if you are up for a lifetime companion that will love you, then pick me! Visit www.wagsresuce.com and submit an application!

Zeke loves to walk and needs to be walked to burn off a lot of his puppy energy. You have to watch him otherwise he will become the alpha of the house, and you.

I am from a southern Tennessee county, where there is no animal control and strays and unwanted animals are in abundance. My mom had me and my siblings last fall at a nice ladies house. One by one my siblings were given away until only I was left. I don’t know why no one wanted me, I was just as playful and loving as the others. So, day after day I waited for my turn. Then, suddenly one day a strange lady drove up the driveway and I was put into the back of her car. I was really nervous because I did not know what to expect. She took me to her house where I met lots of dogs and cats who made me feel at ease. The kind lady told me that I was her new foster pup and that I would never have to live outside again and that she loved me. She LOVED me! It was so nice to hear! I am currently working on becoming the perfect family member such as crate and house training. It’s tough, but I’m learning something new everyday! I am looking for a fur-ever family where I can continue to learn and grow! Could you be my fur-ever family?Sprinkles will be UTD on vaccinations and spayed or neutered at the time of adoption.

The owner does not want to drop them off at a shelter in Tennessee, if she can avoid it.Sami is a senior Black Lab mix who is extremely skittish but lovable. He gets along with most dogs. Over the years he has gotten along with all the animals on my parents' farm except for Spanky.We're not sure what Spanky is mixed with. He is about 5-7 years old. He is playful and lovable. He has gotten along with his playmate Si but does not like Sami. He loves to carry his blanket with him. He is a really good farm dog - he always knows when coyotes are on the property and is great at chasing them away from their goats. He is a drooler especially when he is happy.These dogs do NOT belong to 11th Hour Rescue but we have been asked to help network them for separate adopters. If you can help at all, please contact Jesse directly at jess85_19@hotmail.com - the animals are currently located in Tennessee. These dogs should go to separate homes as they prefer the company of other dogs to each other.There are also 5 cats in need of placement - they are siblings, male and neutered, about 3.5 years old.

If you are looking for personality, she is your gal! She loves to run and play with her jolly ball, then snuggle up with you on the couch in typical pittie fashion. Good with most dogs with proper introductions, she does like to jump when playing with other dogs outside so would do well with another fur sibling who doesn't mind. She LOVES to be with people and will be your baby and buddy for life. She was saved from the euthanasia room in Memphis, TN at the last minute and has been waiting for her very own home ever since.

I was born around 7/3/2016 and weigh 61 pounds. I am a very smart boy who does know a few tricks already! 'Sit' and 'shake' are two of my favorite commands, and I may even know 'speak' (the humans at the shelter aren't sure if I actually know this command yet, or if I just get so excited when I see a treat that I bark). I may know a lot of things, but I would love if you could teach me about having a forever home! It would be best that I go to a home without small children as I can be mouthy at times.  I have a lot of energy and find ways to get in trouble when I do not have an outlet for that energy.  Please be aware that my breed and age listing are estimates. The staff at both shelters do the best they can with that. Obedience classes for adult dogs and puppies can be incredibly helpful for both animals and humans. It helps you understand what makes me tick and will give me a better idea of what you want me to do. It’s a win/win and it will also strengthen the bond between us!

I weigh 21lbs and I am full grown -- perfect size as I am not too big and not too small! I have done well in a foster home with calm small dogs only (under 15 pounds). Don't let my age fool you or the silver highlights, I just had those done before my trip to Arizona in October last year! I am originally from Texas where everything is bigger which means my hunger for activity is the size of a marathon runner! I was found as a stray where they took me into the Palm Valley Animal Center, then I got picked to ride on a transport here to AZSDR. I am a volunteer favorite, my fosters have said I am the most affectionate and loving dog you ever did meet. If you are afraid of kisses and cuddles, I can help you over come your fears instantly! I love people of all shapes, sizes and ages! People are my favorite, which is why I am so excited to find my best friend! I am very well behaved, I am house broken, kennel trained, I walk great on the leash and I also love car rides! I would do best in a home with a yard, no apartments please. I am the perfect gal to take along for hikes and long walks around the neighborhood. With me as your best friend you won't ever have to spend a holiday alone or night without a cuddle buddy. Contact my foster and put in your application to be my forever best friend! Dona Marie is spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and vet checked.

She is an absolute joy and loves her humans (adults and children) but has shown aggression to other dogs and cats in the past — so needs to be an only pet. Dalmatians have specific feeding and care needs, so she will also need a family that understands and is willing to meet those needs with special food and special care when she’s out in the sun.Gypsy loves going on walks, is fully potty trained, and wants to be an active member of her family.

He came from a crowded shelter in Texas where she was turned in as a stray. Since we have little history on him, we are estimating his age to be around five years old and guessing his breeds to be a Husky/Samoyed mix.Shasta is a sweet, loving boy with beautiful blue eyes. He has had a rough life. He was picked up as a stray in Texas where he was likely hit by a car. His injuries were untreated and his pelvis healed on its own, so he struggles a bit on stairs. He is currently in a foster home where he is finally able to give and receive lost of love and attention. He is incredibly sweet with all humans.While he is usually dog-friendly, he doesn't love all dogs and takes longer to warm up to some dog personalities. Given that, he would do best as a single dog. Due to his old injury, he has some minor urinary incontinence when he sleeps which has greatly improved with medicine. He is house-trained, and loves sleeping on hard-wood floors which makes his occasional incontinence easier to clean up! When Shasta came to CCR, he tested positive for heartworm. He's since completed the heartworm treatment and needs to be retested in October. If positive, CCR can cover cost of next treatment (antibiotics most likely) through our approved vets. He also had surgery to correct entropion and is healed from that. This sweet fellow is gentle, smart, and knows basic commands (sit, down, wait, etc). He has had a rough start to life and just wants someone to love him and smother him with cuddles.If you are interested in adopting Shasta, please submit an adoption application located on our website, coloradocaninerescue.org. We are asking for a $100 adoption donation. Shasta is neutered, up to date on vaccinations and microchipped.CCR cannot hold dogs, arrange meet and greets or adopt out any dogs without a completed adoption application.CCR cannot guarantee the breed composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the shelter.Dogs listed as potty trained may experience an adjustment period as they learn the routines in their new home.",

I recently read that I have a better chance of gettin' hit by lightning than winnin' the lottery, but I have won the lottery twice!! About two months ago, I won the shelter dog lottery! Hero dog savers named Susie's Senior Dogs found out about me and posted my picture on the world wide web. My foster mama says I was overnight famous! The next day I won the rescue dog lottery and was deemed an Underdog! I'll just say this...I'm now scared to death of lightning. But wouldn't you be if you knew the statistics and had already won two lotteries?! Anywho, the next couple of weeks were a whirlwind but after moving from Texas to ColoradoI got myself a place to kick up my paws and I'm seein' a doc about my ticker-worms. My doc says I'm in great health, even for my age, so we gave those worms their first eviction notice a month ago. Doc says they usually need a couple reminders to git outta dodge but then I'll be all set to find me a forever family.I'm glad to have some time to get to know myself now that I have the freedom to do so. You see, I spent my life on a chain hiding in the dark (hence why I call myself Shadow). My meals were sporadic and I didn't even know there were beds just for dogs...oh, and have y'all heard about this thing called a couch?!! Maybe lightenin' did strike cause I'm in heaven! Well, here in heaven I've been workin' hard to be everything I know I can be. I'm pretty sure I'm an introvert but my foster mama says not to be too quick to label since I've changed so much. I started out too scared to move and had to be coaxed into eating, drinking, and eliminatin'. But ya know what, turns out some humans ain't all that bad and I'm startin' to learn I have choices and a voice. I'm no longer scared to enjoy my freedom, I obviously don't have a chain anymore so why act like it? I've learned to run around with my foster brothers and I even tried out this thing called a play bow that they taught me. It's pretty cool and everyone gets real excited when I do it. Oh, and I learned about time...meal time to be more precise. And I'm pretty much superior when it comes to reminding my foster parents about it. All ya gotta do is start whoopin' and hollerin' and if it's close enough to meal time, they'll fill the bowl. Like I said, I'm an introvert so while I love myself a good belly rub, hugs are still a little too much. Unless you're a toddler. I have a soft spot for the littles so they get a little extra leeway when it comes to my personal bubble and she's teaching me that (appropriate) hugging is okay. My foster brother is trying to teach me about hunting and keeps getting annoyed that I let the neighbor rabbits and cats hang out around me. But I just have too much love for this second chance to not include everyone in it. Do you want to be in it too?

When she came into rescue her skin was in terrible shape. We don't know whether it was the result of a bad diet, a serious flea allergy, or a bacterial infection. She lost a lot of the hair on her body. While her skin is clear now, we don’t know if her fur will grow back or if she will stay nekked!  She really doesn't seem to care, and she is not scratchy. She enjoys being with her foster siblings in their fenced-in backyard, and would probably prefer a home with a canine companion.Minnie is spayed, she is up to date on her vaccinations (rabies, distemper and kennel cough), vet checked, heartworm tested negative and on preventative while in rescue, and microchipped.

How about hiking or going for long walks ? Can you throw a ball ? Yes, Yes & YES !!! Wow I am excited cause these are my favorite things.My name is Jacky& I am originally from Texas, so I love the sun. They say I am a Beagle/Puggle mix but some people think I have some boxer mixed in there too. But I don't care what you are as long as you treat me well & love me.Sometimes I make mistakes & I am learning. It is best if you leave an old slipper/shoe out when you leave for a few hours & don't crate me. I just like to have something that smells like you. If you take the time to teach me right from wrong I will love you more than words can express, my kisses might tell you how much I LOVE YOU !!I did spend some time wondering on the streets before coming to 2BABR so when it's feeding time I get really excited, I'll even do a dance for you. My foster got me a maze bowl which helps me slow down when eating so I don't get indigestion. Do they make those bowls for humans ? if so you humans may need it too. But I am not judging.I am with another dog right now & we get along. If I had my say I'd like to be with a younger dog... she is 16 yrs old & doesn't want to play with me. Luckily I get to play with my foster & do well independently.Thank you for taking the time to read about me.

Boots has very soulful eyes like he has something to say to you. If he could talk, he'd probably ask you where you were going and what you were doing because he genuinely wants to be by your side participating in whatever you are doing. He is very chill and relaxed and as such would make for the perfect family dog. Boots has a warm personality, which will come in handy while snuggling on the couch during those chilly Colorado evenings. Boots is good with smaller dogs, but gets nervous around larger dogs, so we wouldn't recommend a home with dogs of larger size. Heloves all people, including children. Boots is preparing to complete heartworm treatment at the full expense of the rescue, and he will require monthly heartworm preventative for the remainder of his life (nominal cost)but don't let this dissuade you from meeting this rescue treasure. Please complete a brief online application to meet this wonderful guy and Boots can get to walkinon out of here and into his forever home with you.Adoption fee includes the following: Spay/Neuter Rabies Vaccination Distemper / Parvo Vaccines (includes series of 3 for puppies) Bordetella Microchip with prepaid lifetime registration Deworming",

Toby has been with our rescue for over a year now. Toby is originally from Texas and has been through so much. Toby likes going on walks and hikes and loves playing fetch. He is a smart, loving boy who has had a hard past. We are hoping that someone will see the light in his eyes and give him a chance.A few months ago Toby went through a board and train program to overcome/learn new ways to manage his fear. He has learned so much and we are so grateful for their knowledge and time. Toby can be fearful of new people and is selective of the dogs he likes. It is possible that he could live in house with another dog but it would have to be the right personality match. Because we have invested so much into Toby's growth it is imperative that his foster or adopter be on board with continuing this work, or he might need to redo the board and train program. Toby's adopters will have the support of these trainers for the rest of his life. His adopters will also be required to meet with his trainers to ensure success of adoption. We will never give up on Toby but truly hope that he finds a home soon. While Toby is getting continued training, care, play time & love a boarding facility is not the forever situation we want for him or that he deserves. Can't adopt or foster Toby? Would you consider liking, sharing this or even donating to his care? Toby's weekly bill is around $150. Thank you!",

Lucy appears to be a lab mix, probably born sometime in January 2015. She's a laid-back dog who loves playing with her squeaky chew toys, going for walks, and cuddling. She's happy to go for a ride in the car or relax at home. She's very friendly and just so happy to see you! She's super affectionate and loves people, kids, and other dogs, but she hasn't met any cats yet. She's house trained and is quiet and clean in her crate (where she now sleeps at night), but she does pull when walking on a leash a bit. With some obedience training, she could surely master some essential doggy skills. She's very smart and treat-motivated - a perfect combination for training a new furry friend! Plus, dog training classes are a great opportunity for the pup to bond with her new human(s) and socialize with classmates. Lucy can be food aggressive with other dogs, but has not been with people, so she would need to be fed separately from a fur sibling - she shares a water bowel with no issues. She doesn't go after her foster siblings when they come near her toys, but she will defend them.After being rescued from animal control in Rosenberg, Texas, with her eight new puppies, it's time for Lucy to find her forever home! This beautiful girl understands where her foster feeds her and goes there to eat; she also knows where she gets her treats and goes there, too. She's a real jewel! Have you fallen in love with her sweet face? Fill out an application for Lucy today!Medical Note: This dog has been treated for heartworm disease with melarsomine injections. Once treatment is completed and the dog tests negative for microfilaria, the dog will be cleared to resume normal activity and able to be adopted, which we anticipate to be sometime in December. Untreated heartworm disease can cause lasting damage to the heart, lungs and arteries, and can affect the dog’s health and quality of life even after the parasites are gone, possibly presenting as medical complications and/or new conditions in the future. This dog showed no symptoms of heartworm disease before or during treatment.

Rambo is just about the cutest mixed breed pup in the world! He was born in March 2019 and comes to rescue from Texas. When we got to this sweet boy he was in horrific shape. His head was very swollen as a result of his skull being fractured. We can’t imagine how this little baby got in this condition but after some touch and go our little warrior is doing great! He is getting extra special love and care with an amazing medical foster but he would really love to have a home to call his very own! The vet deemed Rambo a Rottweiler Mix but at his age and weight we think he is mixed with something smaller and will most likely be a more petite version of this guess. Whatever he may be mixed with we think it was the perfect combination! Rambo seems to have some vision and hearing impairment which we will keep assessing to see if this is permanent damage or may continue to get better with time. He doesn’t let this stop him and has blossomed into a happy, feisty, playful guy! He loves romping about with his foster fur siblings and is a professional snuggle partner.

She would love a home of her own to run and play with a loving person or family!Roxie went through months of therapy to heal her wounds, which you can see in some of her pictures.   The doctors think this started as a puncture wound and them spread when it was not treated.    The doctors found her right femur had been fractures and was healing on its own.   The doctors felt it was best to keep the leg as is and she was in no pain so they could focus on treating the wounds on her body.   She does have a peg leg as a result of her old injury.   However Roxie does not know this and is active and gets around fine just like any other dog!   She was an excellent patient as well!

Although he will never walk normal again, he gets around just fine and is able to mobilize on his own. He is doing well with potty training and has adapted to defecting without being able to round his back. He is incredibly happy and loving but likes to be the leader of his pack so a home where his canine friends are non dominant would be the perfect fit for him! He absolutely adores his humans, and will make a devoted companion and snuggle buddy. He has been neutered and is up to date on vaccines.

He is about 5-years-old and was rescued from a high kill shelter in Texas. He is housetrained and crate trained but came to PAWS without any socialization or basic manners. Marlin is currently attending obedience class where he is doing quite well. He is food motivated and likes to keep busy and is responding nicely to new commands – sit, down, wait, stay, come, leave-it. He also likes puzzle games and playing with toys. This adorable little rascal has a lot of anxiety that requires confidence building and supervised exposure to dogs, people and situations. With more practice, Marlin will become a master in no time. After very slow introductions, Marlin is feeling at home with the other two dogs in his foster home. He is a little pushy which doesn’t seem to bother the alpha male but intimidates the submissive female. He has also begun playing with the male dog. Since Marlin has some separation anxiety, a household with other dogs may be helpful as long as he is acclimated properly. Marlin is looking for a forever home where his masters will provide structure, stability, and continue positive reinforcement training and socialization. Marlin is a diamond in the rough awaiting someone who has time to devote to him. His fosters simply adore him but have a full household and can only have temporary canine guests.Check out his video! https://www.dropbox.com/s/aki4xfpeh4h1ood/Marlin%20PAWS%20New%20England%20movie%202019.mp4?dl=0Name: MarlinBreed: Terrier mixSex: MaleAge: 4 years oldWeight: 11 poundsSpayed/Neutered: YesVaccinations: Up to dateHeartworm: NegativeMicrochipped: YesBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS: Dogs: Only with very slow introductions (small dogs)Cats: NoKids: NoAdoption Donation: 450.00IMPORTANT INFORMATION:Interested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog.

For one week Peanut laid suffering and in pain with the finder who did not find it necessary to seek immediate medical care for him. After a week when Peanut was only getting worse, they then decided to drop him off at a high kill shelter. We then were able to step in for poor Peanut and transferred him to our medical partner. Sadly, his wounds were so severe and left untreated for too long and now our sweet Peanut will be left paralyzed. He has a compression fracture in his spine, and his legs are terribly injured as well. The great news for Peanut is that he is safe and on his way to a happy new life. We will get him fitted for some wheels so he can get around and he will be recovering with a great medical foster who specializes in paralyzed dogs. Peanut is a tiny bundle of joy despite what he has been through and will make an amazing addition to any home! He is friendly with people of all ages and other dogs and will be neutered and up to date on vaccines prior to placement in his forever home.

She presented with some neurological symptoms. Hallie spent a few weeks at our San Antonio vet Partner and it was discovered that she was partially blind and deaf. She stumbled a lot and needed further diagnostic testing with a specialty hosp in NY. The specialist has determined that Hallie suffered from some type of trauma to the skull which is what is causing her issues. Sadly we think that she suffered this injury at the hands of humans or possibly suffered some type of brain infection that was never treated. Now we are dealing with her issues head on and she seems to be doing better. She has vision in one eye, and she stumbles less. She so wants to be a normal pup...running and playing with kids, cats, and dogs. Hallie is looking for that special someone who will care for her and her needs.

I really like to chase tennis balls or freesbies, but they always want me to bring it back and sometimes it's more fun to just play with them. I would love to be someone's exercise buddy, hiking partner, or go to the park to play a lot. I do awesome with cats and dogs smaller than me, but dogs my size and bigger scare me so, I would love a home without scary big dogs!

Due to the overpopulation of pets in Texas from the lack of spay and neuter laws and proper pet care, it is extremely difficult to adopt out animals in the state. It is common for rescue organizations to adopt out animals to northern states where there is not a high population of dogs and cats. We have successfully adopted out over 300 animals to out of state families. Our prefered mode of transport from Texas to adoptive families is ground transport such as Rescue Road Trips, PETS LLC, and Your Tx Rescue Connection. We also use air transport in some cases and that varies depending on airline and adoption location. Our adoption fees vary as we typically request for the adopting family to only cover transport and health certificate costs. Please feel free to email us and ask us any questions you may have!",

We are unsure at this time what the long term impact will be since he is so very little and not yet fully mobile. He has been getting around just fine and it seems at this point that he may need a booty later to protect the foot but not necessarily a prosthetic. He does not let his deformity slow him down and loves to race around with his siblings! He is a sweet and playful boy! He can sometimes be a little nervous around strangers and because it may take some time for him to adjust and warm up we feel a home with older, respectful children would be best suited for Jack.

We got Marcos immediately to our vet partner where he received all the medical care that he needed. He had surgery to correct his pelvis and is doing great!

He can become scared around loud noises and would do best in rural/surburban setting with a fenced yard. Due to his old injuries, his ideal forever home would be one with older kids who understand his space and won't jump all over him. He does great with other dogs, doesn't mind them at all but is not overly eager to be playful. Puppies or younger very active canine friends may be a little overwhelming for him.

The conditions werent the best to say the least and oh yeah, I was SUPER pregnant. Not a good place for a expecting mom. Thankfully, I was taken from there just in time and was able to have my puppies in a foster home. I was even thrown a huge baby shower by a ton of people who follow SNARR! I was so happy to finally have had my babies and be out of the shelter but my excitement quickly became tragedy. Not long after giving birth, almost half of my babies passed away- only 4 survived. Now that my remaining pups have gone to live their own liveshere I sit and wait. While I adore my foster mom, I want a home to call my own. Im confused on why I dont have my own home yet Im incredibly adorable and Im hands down the most wiggly tushed pocket pittie youll ever meet! I have never met a person I didnt like, however dogs.not too fond of dogs or any other furry little creatures. I blame that on my high prey drive and Im very smart when it comes down to it- I can be a pro stalker and Im lightning fast so its best that the temptation isnt there in forever home.

Due to having allergies, I take Benedryl and cannot eat chicken.Transport to any approved home within the US can be provided at no additional feeCurrently Skyy is located in Lawrenceville, Georgia.Please visit SNARRANIMALRESCUE.org to fill out an adoption application and our adoption requirements/process can also be found there!",

She is a protective girl who is not very stranger tolerant, so the meet-and-greet procedure with her must be more drawn out and she belongs only in a home comfortable with not allowing strangers to make direct contact with their dog.  Other than that, she is pretty close to perfect.  She can be in public settings where strangers are respectfully hands off.  Approximately four years old, she was pulled from a high kill shelter in Texas heavily pregnant and successfully raised a litter of puppies while being a wonderful mom.  She is now ready to move onto a forever ending of her own :)  She is purebred, although her ears did fail to stand, and a real deal GSD.   She is GREAT company - very playful, joyful and extremely affectionate.  If a German Shepherd can be merry, that would be her.  She is highly intelligent (both the good and the bad....she is an escape artist who can range from smart to daring), very responsible, forms a strong bond, and is an energetic girl with an extremely playful and fun personality.   For the breed, she is not a noisy dog, does great with other dogs, and is ok around cats. Older children only, please, as toddlers make her nervous.  THE RIGHT HOME for Queenie needs to have breed experience.  Queenie is territorial and protective by her nature.  When displaced, she forms a strong bond, but meet-and-greets will require patience and understanding as she is not receptive to strangers.  This is a higher energy girl who belongs with someone active.  She crates well and is overall a good housedog, but if bored and under stimulated will be destructive.  She will do fine in a home with another  dog and has learned not to bother cats, but she should not be around smaller children - they are very foreign to her and she finds their movements unsettling.  If you need a dog who can thrive in social settings, she is not the dog for you as while she can be socialized better with strangers, her social circle being an elite group of knowns is inherent to both her and the breed itself.  If, however, you seek a adventurous companion, up for anything, who bonds strongly and is extremely loyal, she could be the dog for you.Applications are available on the southpawsexpress.org website or by contacting Lucy at maramuser@gmail.com.  Her adoption fee is $450.",

Please welcome our FREEDOM PUPS as they take their freedom ride from Texas to New Jersey!!Lewis and Clark the intrepid explorers made their way across the United states over a two year period. Tasked by the president many, many years ago. They showed bravery grit.The same can we said for these two travelers, along with their mum, Sacagewea.Each had the worst start imaginable. There mum was surrendered to a high killshelter. She had given birth to both of these pups two days previously and was still in labor, unable to get the pups out and given no medical care or meds. When she arrived we had a foster meet her family in a car in the car park and swoop up mom and pups and take them immediately for surgery. A c-section was performed and there were three other pups. Twohad already passed inside mom and the third survived but sadly died that day. Mum her self almost died too. It was touch and go for a few days after but then with much strength like their forefather's they made it through.Mum, Sacagewea, is a young dachsund blend weighing 35 pounds. She is doing well now and can't wait to meet her forever family to give her the life she deserves. Sacagewea is crate trained and about 90% potty trained.

Noelle is looking for a home to call her own! She was rescued from Texas in December of 2017. Noelle had been hit by a car and was taken to the local Animal Control, she was terrified and in danger of euthanasia. We committed to her and had her seen by a local vet. Noelle was found to be pregnant, we were told she was “just barely pregnant”. We decided to allow her to have her puppies, within a week of arrival Noelle went into labor (turns out she was far more than “just barely pregnant”!). She delivered 10 puppies, 3 naturally and 7 by emergency C-Section. Sadly two puppies did not survive. The 8 surviving puppies thrived thanks to a wonderful and doting momma. Noelle has come so very far, she has warmed up to people. She is a very sweet girl who now that her role as momma has concluded has seen the Orthopedic Surgeon to determine what can be done to help her hind legs. Sadly the injuries are old and healed therefore nothing can be done. Noelle’s story had a very sad beginning but we hope the second half will be nothing short of a Fairytale in a forever home. Noelle is current on vaccines and preventatives, she has been spayed and is microchipped.Her adoption fee is $300. we adopt to a 2.5 hour radius of zip code 21034.

A supporter of BTN snatched Xena and her babies right up and fostered them until we could arrive to bring her back to PA for fostering.  Xena is a complete joy.  Grateful for everything she has been given.. Loves kids.  Has not been cat tested yet.  She is a bit guarding around other dogs but she has her 6 babies and is protective of them - understandable.  Completely fine with people around the babies though.  Her foster mom says she is a dream and is extremely sweet.  Xena has a bit of energy as you can see in her video.

She came to us from a Texas shelter that was needing to move some dogs out because of their high-kill rate (to make room for others). Her foster from Texas said she had gotten along with a few other dogs and children, but since arriving at Safe Haven, we have actually not been able to find any dog friends that she gets along with. Molly has a very dominant personality with other dogs, so this makes living in a shelter setting pretty stressful for Molly.Unfortunately we have tried to introduce Molly to several other dogs during her time at Safe Haven, and have even taken her on a few day trips to meet other dogs - and so far Molly has not been able to get along with any other dogs, so we feel she will do best as an only dog in her forever home. Her foster in Texas also told us that she really is much too interested in 'playing' with chickens and she would suggest her not going to a home where there are chickens. This behavior also transfers over to cats unfortunately - and Molly will need a home with no cats. So if you have a home without any other pets, you may just have the perfect home for our Molly! After watching her in action when she was left to wander about in the room with us during a meeting or two, I have to think she has a wicked sense of humor and such a silly-dog streak in her personality. More than once she stole items individuals had laying by their chairs and would strut around with the item waiting for us to realize what she had done! Molly would certainly be an awesome dog for someone that is active and looking for a devoted companion.Like all of our dogs she is up to date on parasite preventatives, vaccinations and is microchipped and spayed (neutered).Interested in adopting?

Allison was rescued from an animal cruelty case in Texas. Despite her not so great start to life, it only takes a few hours and she's happy to give you her whole heart. Allison loves to snuggle and take walks. She gets along well with the resident dogs in her foster home but would be fine as an only dog as well. Allison is a great eater, kennels well, and is house broken. She is sensitive to loud noises, so would not be a good candidate for off leash training, as she spooks fairly easily. Allison is estimated to be 2-3 years old and weighs about 50 pounds. She would be super easy to train as a support animal if that's something you need, too -- she LOVES to snuggle and be with her person. If you're looking for a sweet, affectionate pup to join your family, Allison is the girl for you! Apply at www.foreverhomedogs.org to meet her!All adoptions are $200 per dog which include spay/neuter, micro-chipped and up-to-date on required shots. Senior dogs, at our discretion, are adopted out at $100 per dog because we know they will have less time with your family and may eventually have more needs as they get older. But we feel these dogs deserve to live out the rest of their lives as part of a loving family.",

JOSEPH is neutered, core vaccines, de-wormed, monthly preventives and micro-chipped. He has an estimated date of birth of 17 February 2019 and at the time of rescue in the middle of June 2019, weighed around 30 pounds. He is listed as a Golden Retriever / German Shepherd Dog. We have no way of knowing the exact breed, it is up to individuals to decide what breed they think is most likely.Joseph was living with a foster family in Texas whilst waiting for transport and here is the great information they shared with us.The shelter named him Joshua but he never came to that. We called him Petey from the Little Rascals movie.His routine- he wakes up when we do around 5:30 am and he goes potty outside and eats his breakfast. He loves food especially TREATS! We caught him once holding his food bowl around the living room. My husband and I leave for work around 6:30 am. He stays in his crate that we bought him all morning and then my husband goes home at lunch to let him out. He goes outside and does his business. Then he gets back in his crate. We’ve had him for 6 days and the only time he had a problem with his crate was when it was raining and he didn’t go potty that morning, so he needed to get out and go. ( we put a dog camera on his house to watch him). Then we’re home by 5:00 pm and he eats dinner (we do dry food. Right now he eats Eukanuba dog brand because that’s what we feed our dogs). He plays for a little bit but really just watches my two dogs. He isn’t afraid of toys, he just acts like he doesn’t know what to do with them. We go to bed around 9:00 pm and he sleeps all night! He did sleep with us for the few days we had him. No accidents on the bed! The first two nights he woke up a few times and we let him outside to potty and then he came back to bed. He is the CUTEST sleeper! He is so long that he stretches and takes up half the bed. One night I woke up and his face was resting on my shoulder. He is so stinking cute. All he wants is love. love. love.Behavior - he knows how to sit, he learns quickly. He gives lots of kisses. He generally plays well with other dogs. I have a dachshund and it’s like he never saw a small dog before. He just followed her around and wanted to play with it. No fighting or anything. He was more curious than anything. He was more curious and observant with my two dogs, just wanted to see what was going on. I also have a mini Australian Shepherd and he wanted to play with him. Really he wanted to play with my two dogs more than they wanted to play with him. He wasn’t aggressive, no fighting.The only bad thing is that he’s a puppy still so he’s still potty training. And that’s not bad, just that he’s a puppy and still learning! He did learn to go to our back door within a couple of days! We have a doggy door and he did go through it once by himself. He had a few accidents while we had him but he’s still potty training and he knew what he did was wrong.He likes- he loves everyone!!! He’s been around my husband and I, my sister and my two grand mothers and they ALL loved him. He loves treats and giving kisses and snuggles and espionage belly rubs!! LOVES his belly rubbed. He likes bones. We gave him a puppy Nylabone and he likes to chew on that. He likes to try and play with toys. He just doesn’t know what to do with toys. He’s not scared of them, just not sure what to do. Hopefully he’ll be in a house where he’ll have all the toys in the world :). Our dogs love to play with balls, so he was slowly learning to go get it when we had him.He’ll make a great family dog!!! I don’t see him having any problems with small children. He was never around a cat, but he’d probably do the same thing he did with my mini dachshund, just kinda paw at it and try and play. He likes to lay his head on blankets and make a bed. He just wants to feel safe and comfy with lots of love.JOSEPH is available for adoption for an adoption fee of US $550Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada.

She has been great with a young teenage girl and is happy to just share in the love she has.She does have a lot of energy so an active lifestyle is a must. As with all dogs basic obedience and general training is needed so that she can learn the new rules, boundaries and expectations of her new family and home.I do not know how ELSA would be around cats or livestock.She rides great in the car, walks great on the leash, is great with other dogs and people of all ages, she uses the dog door to get in and out to play or to do her business but she won't know to let her new family know she needs to go out, so a few accidents whilst she goes through this big transition should be expected and then if there are not any, it is a bonus :)All dogs (except dogs saved from China) are available for adoption for an adoption fee of $550.Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada.

CHIP-L is neutered, core vaccines, rabies, heartworm and tick disease tested negative, monthly preventatives and microchipped. He has an estimated date of birth of 20 April 2016 and at the time of rescue in May 2018 weighed around 11 pounds.CHIP, PRINCE, MILO & PIXIE were all saved together. When I had informed the shelter I would take them into rescue, they informed me they were scheduled to be killed that day because they were feral. I had committed to them and so I couldn't back out.When they got here I let them with the other dogs and just left them to it as I think it is important for dogs to decompress and figure out what has happened to them the last week, being picked up by animal control, taken to a large city kill shelter, having surgery and all the vetting then on a transport up to the rescue for 3 days, then getting here - it is so much for them all in such a short time.CHIP has come a very long way and will come and sit next to me, he will let me scratch his head, belly, he will play although he does \""mouth\"" when playing. He gets very excited when playing and is a very sweet boy. I let him build his confidence on his own and come up to me when he felt ready. At first it was taking treats and then this slowly progressed to me scratching his chest and ears, then eventually his belly. He is truly desperate for affection and he wants nothing more than to cuddle up on my lap. At times he has sneaked on the chair next to me and gone to sleep, however, he will not let me pick up he will run off, but then immediately come back.As you can see in the video he does want to play, but he does \""mouth\"" when playing and at times can put a bit too much pressure, he is not biting he just doesn't know he is playing too hard, but I gently correct him, telling him no and he does stop. This will take time, but the fact he has come so far on his own, in his own time, I believe with the right family he has huge potential.CHIP needs a family that understands he is going to need time to figure things out again and do things at his own pace. He isn't going to be jumping on your lap snuggling up straight away, he isn't going to let you pick him up or take him for walks for a considerable time so a fenced in yard is an absolute must. With time, love and patience everything can come, being with a family that has time to spend with him, teaching him things and helping him gain trust will enable him to develop the confidence and trust he needs.We do not recommend children more because of his mouthing little hard and also children are not as patient in allowing him to progress at his own pace.CHIP truly is a very sweet boy, he enjoys the other dogs, he enjoys sitting on the back of the sofa watching the squirrels and birds at the feeding stations. He loves to get attention and deserves the best family and forever home.We do not have cats or livestock at the rescue so cannot comment on how he would be around or with them.All dogs (except dogs saved from China) are available for adoption for an adoption fee of $550.Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada. This fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of pulling, vetting, health certificate, transport from Texas to Maine, monthly preventatives, supplements, food and anything else that is needed.If you feel that you have the heart and home to give this precious soul a wonderful life, please go to our website, under the APPLICATION tab, complete, then submit the APPLICATION.

She loves to chase and be chased and will play and wrestle with the other dogs and then relax and sleep cuddled up amongst them. She can be vocal when she is playing and does instigate play, and is great with both small, medium and large dogs.She would be a great family pet, she is so much fun, so loving and gentle. She is always friendly and happy to see me or the volunteers that come occasionally come over.As with all dogs she will need basic and advanced training so that so she can learn her families rules, boundaries and expectations. NOEL is very responsive and I feel that she will be easy and fun to train and will be eager to please.

TINKERBELL is spayed, core vaccines, rabies, de-wormed, heartworm and tick disease tested negative and micro-chipped. She has an estimated date of birth of 3 December 2015 and at the time of rescue at the beginning of December 2018 weighed around 17.60 pounds. She is listed as a Yorkshire Terrier / Cairn Terrier Mix. We have no way of knowing the exact breed, it is up to individuals to decide what breed they think is most likely.TINKERBELL IS NOT GOOD WITH CATS.TINKERBELL was adopted at the end of December 2018 but was returned to the rescue in February 2019 due to her having prey drive for the families cats. They tried to make it work, but were concerned for both the cats well-being and also of Tinkerbell and so with sad hearts they brought her back. They said she was very active and would need a family that does go on walks and adventures and gives here the opportunity to run a lot. They was training her to stand on her back feet for treats and had a lot of fun with her. After a few days the family reached back out stating that they are going to build a place for the cats as they want her back in their lives, so they came and picked her back up. Sadly this only lasted for a few months since Tinkerbell continued to be aggressive with the cats.In March Tinkerbell had 3 seizures within the month and the vet prescribed prednisone. No cause has been diagnosed and she has been doing great, but this is of course a consideration for families when they consider adopting her as she may need life-long medications, which prednisone is very in-expensive, but since she stll has a lot of life in her, regular testing would be recommended.When Tinkerbell arrived at the rescue in December she was very shy and a little over-whelmed with all the other dogs. After a few days she settled down and got into the routine, although she was still reserved and didn't like being with a lot of dogs. When in a smaller groups she was fine. She has never been aggressive with other dogs or protective over food or anything else whilst here at the rescue. She rides great in the car and loves to snuggle.As with all rescue's she needs guidance and training and we recommend families go through at least the basics of training with her themselves so that boundaries, personalities and body language can be learned from each other. TINKERBELL is very responsive and training would be fun and easy as long as proper training techniques are followed and are consistent.Although Tinkerbell is a small dog, she is an active girl and walks, runs and adventures is important for her to live a fulfilled life.We do not recommend dog parks for several weeks, if not months, it is so very important for families and dogs to form a strong bond and get to know each other before exposing them to the potential dangers of dog parks. Although all GaDaH dogs are very well socialized with other dogs, lots of other dogs have not had the benefit of this socialization and do not always know how to play and act with other dogs. You also do not know the control the other families have over their dogs and you should always have a good recall for your adopted dog before going to dog parks.All dogs (except dogs saved from China) are available for adoption for an adoption fee of $550.Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada.

We have no way of knowing the exact breed, it is up to individuals to decide what breed they think is most likely.BROOKE was adopted in November 2018, however, returned to the rescue in April 2019 because she was fearful of the husband. After living with a family for 5 months she is of course confused as to what happened to her own home and family that she loved. Unfortunately we cannot explain to them what has happened and so she went through a sad time, but has bounced back and is happy playing with the other dogs.We do not have cats or livestock at the rescue so are unable to comment how any dog is or will be around them. BROOKE is going to need a family that is willing and has the time and patience to work with her apparent fear of men. She has never been aggressive in anyway, and so it is just going to take some love and understanding and I am sure she will warm up and get over any fears she might have.Brooke did live with a family that had 5 young children and so is good with kids. She loves to chase and play with the dogs of all ages and sizes.As with all dogs he will need basic and advanced training so that she can learn her families rules, boundaries and expectations.

We have no way of knowing the exact breed, it is up to individuals to decide what breed they think is most likely.Since being at the rescue BUSTER has lived amongst a lot of dogs of all ages and sizes ranging from small chi's, middle sized dogs up to adult German Shepherds and so he is very dog socialized and very confident. He is friendly with people and has enjoyed cuddles from a friends 7 year old granddaughter.We do not have cats or livestock at the rescue so cannot comment on how he would be around them.BUSTER is young and used to being around lots of dogs so we are hoping for a family who either adopts another rescue or who has other pets at home. He is a young pup and so chewing is very much to be expected. He does use pee pads but also at times does use the dog door to go outside. He will need house training along with all basic training, manners and general behaviour. His personality is still developing and so it will be up to the family to ensure he stays a loving, gentle, playful, affectionate pup whilst growing into an adult dog.Since being at the rescue he is totally loving life, he loves to play with toys, chew on hooves and horns, wrestle and chase with the other dogs and get lots of love and cuddles as much as he can. He is high energy and he feeds of the excitement of the other dogs, but does calm down and settle after a while. He is a great boy who has never shown any kind of aggression in any way.As with all rescue's he needs guidance and training and we recommend families go through at least the basics of training with him themselves so that boundaries, personalities and body language can be learned from each other.

TILLY is spayed, core vaccines, rabies, de-wormed, heartworm tested negative and micro-chipped. She has an estimated date of birth of 18 April 2010 and weighs around 14.20 pounds. She has been listed as a Cairn Terrier Fox Terrier Mix. We have no way of knowing the exact breed, so it is up to individuals to decide what breed they think is most likely.At the beginning of June 2018, Tilly was adopted and went to start her new life. Unfortunately in the middle of March 2019 I received an email from the family saying that she would need to be returned to the rescue. The problems the family had was that Tilly had started to get protective of her chair, and her home, she would bark and growl at people coming into the home. The family took her to the vet who recommended a training program and then anxiety medications. Tilly's negative behaviour continued and the family again reached out to the vet wanting her taken off the medication as there had been no significant improvement, the vet, even knowing that the rescue would take her back offered euthanasia as an option. Tilly had not bitten anyone and she had not a recent physical exam or blood panel done to rule out any medical issues for her personality change. Thankfully the family brought her back to the rescue.When TILLY first got back to the rescue I noticed how over-weight she was. I put her in the bedroom which is off the main living area where there is a gate installed so she could come out of her crate and get to know the dogs and start to decompress slowly. She was at first growly with me which I tolerated for the first day back, on day two I shouted at her, pointing and telling her \""no, this behaviour was not acceptable\"". I sat on the floor and within minutes she came belly-crawling over and turned over next to me to let me scratch her belly. That has been the extent of her aggression.After a few days I let her out into the main living area with the 20 other dogs of all ages and sizes and she was a little over-whelmed, she had places she could go to have her own space which she did do mostly for the first week. She was very needy in that she would want to jump up on my knee and followed me around, which was to be expected since that was what she was used to with her family and also I am sure she wanted to be near me for a bit of security. I didn't allow this as it is important to know that she is not going to dictate the rules, that she is a member of the family, but is not in charge. At the time of writing this Tilly has been back at the rescue for 2 weeks and she has been doing great, she has growled at the other dogs, but only for them to get out of her space, she instigated play with one of the smaller dogs and is definitely coming out of her shell and getting a lot more confidence in walking around.The rescue has had her to the vet to have blood drawn and a full CBCand 27 Chemistry panel including testing for thyroid issues so that we can rule out hypothyroidism, some symptoms are weight gain and sudden aggression. Her extensive blood and chemistry panel came back good with nothing of any concern. She had a vets appointment on 9th April and had an examination that went well and it was agreed from the information and medical assessment that this is more of a behaviour issue and she just needs a family that will not let her get away with things, which will encourage negative behaviour. We think it was more that she was allowed to become \""alpha\"" of the home and family, which led to her being territorial and consequently aggressive. The good thing is that there are no medical issues that we need to worry about.TILLY is going to need a family that understands that she has exhibited negative behaviour and is confident and comfortable in giving a negative consequence to a negative behaviour, like you would do with children or any human for that matter. Her family said she absolutely loved going for walks and car rides and was a really happy go lucky girl although a little timid at times and they truly was heartbroken how things developed but did the right thing in bringing her back since they was not able to deal with her behaviour.Rescue Bio before TILLY was returned.TILLY doens't act 8 years old, she is pretty active, very playful, she is great with other dogs, but not too bothered in playing with them all the time, she likes to follow me around and will get a silly mood and spin around when I go over to feed and clean. She has a mischievous streak in she was trying to pull the to the other side of the fence she was on and started pulling it apart. She loves to have mad dashes and spins around in her crazy moments.We do not have cats or livestock at the rescue, so we cannot comment on how she would respond or act with or around them.A volunteer brought her young granddaughter over and she was great with her, initially she was a little bit shy, but soon warmed up and very loving and wanting to get lots of attention.TILLY does use the dog door to go out to do her business. I do not know if she would let you know she needs to go out since she has 24/7 access to the outside, so it is important to note she will most likely need some training.She is going to need a family that is used to small dogs. Someone who understand that he will need training and guidance and learns that humans are in charge so that he doesn't get too much of a handful. A somewhat active family who can give him the lifestyle that she needs. Going on road trips, to new places, hikes and adventures and letting her explore the sights, smells and sounds the world has to offer will be to his and your benefit. We do not recommend dog parks for several weeks, if not months, it is so very important for families and dogs to form a strong bond and get to know each other before exposing them to the potential dangers of dog parks. Although all GaDaH dogs are very well socialized with other dogs, lots of other dogs have not had the benefit of this socialization and do not always know how to play and act with other dogs. You also do not know the control the other families have over their dogs and you should always have a good recall for your adopted dog before going to dog parks.TILLY is available for adoption for an adoption fee of $550. Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada.This fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of pulling, vetting, health certificate, transport from Texas to Maine, monthly preventatives, supplements, food and anything else that is needed.If you feel that you have the heart and home to give this precious soul a wonderful life, please go to our website, under the APPLICATION tab, complete, then submit the APPLICATION.

MINNIE and MICKEY are a fun loving pair, they are very bonded and although play with the other dogs, always end up playing together and sleeping cuddled up together. They are great with the other dogs and love to run and charge around. They are extremely affectionate and love being up on the chair or sofa snuggling.As with all dogs they will need basic and advanced training so that they can learn their families rules, boundaries and expectations. They are very responsive and I feel that they will be easy and fun to train and will be eager to please.

HARMONY is spayed, core vaccines, rabies, de-wormed, monthly preventatives and micro-chipped. She has an estimated date of birth of 8 November 2018 and at the time of rescue in the middle of April 2019, weighed around 23.60 pounds. She is listed as an Jack Russel Terrier / Lab Retreiver mix. We have no way of knowing the exact breed, it is up to individuals to decide what breed they think is most likely.HARMONY has only been at the rescue a very short time so we are unable to comment much on her personality at the moment, other than she is a really, sweet playful, fun loving pup with a tonne of energy. She is going to need an active family and someone who understands and is willing to work with her on training, obedience. We will update when she has been here and settled so we can give a more accurate description of her personality and mannerisms.We do not know how she is around cats or livestock at the rescue so are unable to comment how any dog is or will be around them.All dogs (except dogs saved from China) are available for adoption for an adoption fee of $550.Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada. This fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of pulling, vetting, health certificate, transport from Texas to Maine, monthly preventatives, supplements, food and anything else that is needed.If you feel that you have the heart and home to give this precious soul a wonderful life, please go to our website, under the APPLICATION tab, complete, then submit the APPLICATION.

I arrived to my foster in Virginia on June 15th. I am currently living with my foster family in Sterling, VA which includes 4 humans (a mom, a dad, a young adult, and a teen) along with 3 other furkids (large, medium, and small).I am really enjoying getting to know them and they are all teaching me what the rules are and treating me like one of the family. My favorite things to do are to play catch and practice my howling with the teen, play with the other pups, well the ones that like to play (there's an old gal who has let me know that my youthful energy is not appreciated), and chill with the pack. She also takes me on walks (I'm still learning how to walk with that long stringy thing) and runs with me in the yard. When we are done, she spends time with me on the floor rubbing my belly or scratching my ears ( I REALLY love that part).Sometimes during the day I just like to chill in one of my crates or on the floor. They have lots of cushy stuff to lay on so it's comfortable and I like having my own space at times.I'm minding my P's and Q's and eating nicely and not making a mess when I drink water. I'm looking for a furever home with a loving family who is patient so I can learn things. I would be great on my own or with other dogs, but I like an active life. I really like these older kids, but it would be great to meet some smaller ones to see if I like them too. I heard there are these other creatures called cats, but I haven't met one yet to see if I like them or if they like me. I'm gonna let my foster mom take it from here to tell you a little more about me. (she likes to brag)Hiya, Shana's Foster Mom here. From the moment my husband saw Shana's eyes he knew we needed to pull her from the kill shelter. She has fit in with our pack so easily and very quickly. She was originally quiet on the ride home, but once in the house became more verbal. She was spayed on day three of having her and is healing nicely. She knows a few basic commands like sit, crate and is learning stay. She has not shown any signs of food aggression and is highly food motivated when training. You can see the intelligence in her eyes when you are teaching her. Keep in mind, she is young and has a lot of energy, but if you are active with her, she is a dream through the night.We noticed that she is most verbal when others approach her humans, thus showing a protective nature of the people she loves. When our teen leaves, she cries for her a little then goes to lay down. She sleeps in the crate with no issues and has even handled the cone of shame like a champ. (Our dogs all hated it.)Shana is definitely an alpha female and likes to be in charge. Because she is young, she has a ton of energy and would be best suited with a family that is active outdoors.We were honored to be able to name her because she was found by the dog catcher in south Texas and put in the shelter. She had a collar on with 2 feet of chain on it that she had been dragging around. They suspect her previous owners had her chained up outside when the hurricanes hit Texas and she managed to escape, but no one ever came to claim her and she was placed on the kill list.Once she was on their site, one of our SSR volunteers saw her and posted her pics. That's when my hubby saw her. Almost everyone was commenting on the post and saying how pretty she is, so I asked the SSR founders if we could name her Shana, which is \""pretty\"" in Yiddish. The rest is history!We are looking for a very special family who will deserve her love because she has so much to give. If YOU are that family, please submit your application right away. We will attend as many adoption events as we can so you can meet her. If you're still with me in reading all of this, you could be the family she's looking for!

I'm Sheba. I was picked up as a stray in Texas in July and brought to my foster home at the end of October. I am not spayed and have never been pregnant so I was likely not a stray for very long. I am currently in heat. Once that is finished I will get spayed and then start on treatment for heartworm. I am told that my foster dad is not looking for a forever home for me until I am spayed, though.I had an interesting first 24 hours with my new foster dad. He picked me up from the nice ladies who drove me all the way from Texas to Virginia and took me straight to a place where I got a bath. I was very good for my bath and allowed him to do all the things that he had to do to get me \""clean\"". I thought I was just fine the way I was but the warm water was nice. I then met the 2 owners of the house, Duke who is a German Shepherd like me and Lily who is a Border Collie mix. They smelled Ok, I guess. I did not pay too much attention to them. I then had a look around the house. While I was doing that my foster dad got some food for me which I ate really quickly. He says I am \""overly enthusiastic\"" when I eat and I try to see what is on the kitchen counters a lot, but I am just really hungry and it is hard to get over not knowing when your next meal will be. I slept in a crate all night and was so tired, I did not fuss at all.I then went for a walk around the block. It was a nice walk and I just followed my foster dad. I don't usually pull on the leash but sometimes when I see a squirrel or fox or deer I want to chase them. I don't try too hard to do that because my leash and collar stop me and I don't want to pull too hard.In the morning I went to the vet. That is when we figured out I was in heat. I was very good for the doctor and let her do all the things she needed to. I did not complain at all.I sometimes chase my tail and chew on it. I also have a bit of a hotspot on my back but that is clearing up. We are going to ask about my tail, though. I have chewed through much of the hair there.I always like to be with my foster dad but sometimes he puts me in a crate. That is ok but I don't like it when I hear him but can't be with him. I try and jump around in my crate and make noises so he will come get me out. If he does not then I will stop after 5 minutes or so. I am good with being in my crate at night and when he goes out, though.I understand a few of the words dad uses to ask me to do things. I know sit, stay (although for these I usually will expect a treat at some point), and come. There are others but he has not figured them out and I am surely not going to tell him what they are. Gotta make him work for it. I have gotten along well with my foster brother and sister so far. I have met dogs when we walk and they have seemed nice. I am not sure how I feel about cats but if they run I will chase them so dad does not think I would be good with them.A couple of days after I got to Virginia there was something called Halloween. Not sure what that was but dad and I sat outside while a bunch of strange small people came up to the house. Dad said I was very well behaved and I let a lot of them pet me. There were some really small ones, too.My foster dad tells me I am nice to have around and once I figure out that I will never have to worry about eating so I am not so enthusiastic about my food (and treats) and stop counter surfing, I will be a really awesome family member.If you want to see more about my day to day progress, click this link https://trello.com/b/ce6g2fmk.

People call me a handsome bullmatian from Fort Worth, TX. My foster mom pulled me from the really scary shelter and moved me all the way to New Hampshire! She tells me I’m a really good boy, but the first two years and eight months of my life weren’t easy. The scary shelter guys found me on the streets, then I spent four months in a loud, dirty puppy jail known as the shelter.This was a scary place for me and being behind bars made me terrified of people.  They would walk by, stare in my kennel, I would cower and growl to prevent them from coming in, not realizing I was losing any chance I had in finding a home.  After four months, my time was up and on that last day my foster mom saw me and for whatever her reason was, she picked me!  That was my lucky day to break free of jail!   I had no idea my life was about to get better!My foster mom is kind, gentle and patient and within a few days I was able to shake off the shelter blues and start learning how to trust, love and be loved again.  It’s been a slow process, but a steady one and I’m enjoying being loyal canine companion!Naturally, I’m still working on confidence and trust and I’m still a little afraid of crates, but I’m trying to work past all that.  It sometimes takes me a while to warm up to humans, but if they give me time and space, I will gently engage when I’m ready.  Some of my favorite activities are walking, cuddling and playing with my toys!  I have wonderful leash skills and I have to say I’m pretty athletic too!  My foster mom is teaching me new tricks like sit and stay and I’m eager to learn even more!   I’m really good with the “drop” word too, probably because I think some of my foster mom’s things are toys and she uses that word a lot, especially when I take her pillows.I’m okay with other dogs as long as they are respectful.  Puppies and high energy dogs make me nervous so I would prefer a home where I can get all of the attention to myself, or one with another low-key, mellow canine friend.   I’ve never met a kitty face to face, but I don’t care to chase the strays in the neighborhood.  Being with my foster mom is way better than chasing any kitties.My ideal home would be with adults who like to enjoy the outdoors.  A family that has routine, likes to be with their canine companion, continue to teach new skills and confidence, one with patience and understanding and one that will enjoy watching my wings spread.   I am looking forward to putting my past behind me and look forward to a future and a family.",

He likes to try to play with the resident kitty, so may do ok in a home with a cat that would be more prone to hide away than defend itself aggressively. Due to his high energy level, he will need a fenced yard and an active owner. And older, respectful children should be ok, too. He can be pretty aloof, somewhat independent, until he tires out. Then he turns into a cuddle bug. Timber likes to bring the outside indoors, like twigs and pinecones. But also enjoys chew toys and tennis balls. He's a fan of playing in his water dish and drinking from the outdoor water hose. He would make an excellent jogging or hiking partner.Timber is neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and ready for his forever family!Timber is available for adoption through Pet Tales Rescue in Grand Rapids, MI. Please go to www.pettalesrescue.com and fill out an application. His adoption fee is $265 plus $15 for the microchip for a total of $280 payable by cash or card through the rescue's website.* Pet Tales Rescue does not have a physical shelter location as all of our pets are in foster homes. To meet Timber or one of our other fosters, you will need to fill out an application. After your application is reviewed, one of our volunteers will contact you to set up a time to meet him.

Regina is a 7-year old lab mix looking for a loving home. She came all the way from Texas and was heartworm positive but has now finished her treatment and is ready to find her furever home. We suspect Regina had a pretty rough life before arriving to Pet Tales, therefore she will need someone who is patient and willing to work with her to earn her trust. Regina gets nervous when meeting new people and takes quite a while to feel comfortable, but once she settles in she is a very calm and sweet dog. She prefers a quiet home and gets along with other calm dogs but would also do well as an only dog. She loves spending most of her day relaxing on the couch but also likes to explore the backyard when it’s time for a potty break. Regina also likes to alert you when someone is at the door or if there is a squirrel on the deck. She is the perfect size at 50 lbs and is just looking for someone to love her and provide a safe place to enjoy her golden years.Regina is available for adoption through Pet Tales Rescue in Grand Rapids, MI.

We had her in our home for one week before she gave birth to a litter of 8 puppies. She did an amazing job raising her puppies and she is now ready for a loving forever home to call her own.Minnie is such a loving, sweet girl. She get's along very well with our three small resident dogs and all other dogs that we have encountered while out and about. She is pretty interested in our cat so a dog savvy cat or no cat home would probably be best for her. She has never tried to hurt our cat, but does chase her around at times.Minnie is great with going potty outside on a leash. She did have a few accidents when we first got her, but since then she has been doing wonderful. She is crate trained and will go into her crate on demand (although it's not her favorite place). She doesn't bark or cry in there at all and does sleep in a crate all night without making any noises. However, she does great out of her crate during the day while we are out of the house so she will probably prefer a nice soft bed or couch to sleep on vs. being in a crate. She does jump over the puppy/baby gates in our home, but it's only to get to her people and then she is happy as can be.Minnie is absolutely amazing with everyone! She loves kids and adults and just wants to get head scratches and lounge around with you. She is fairly low energy, but does love to go for walks. She loves car rides and happily watches out the window. She is all around a sweet and loving girl that can't wait to find her forever home so she can relax and be part of a family.",

My name is Cuddles, although I am slightly embarrassed to admit that. I do like a good cuddle (my foster dad let me snooze with my head in his lap while he watched TV last night) and particularly a good ear scratch or belly rub, it sounds kind of like I’m a low energy pup. I have my moments of mellow-ness, but I also love a good zoom around the back yard or playing chase orwrasslingwith my foster brother or getting to go for a walk! My foster mom says I could use some work on my leash manners, but I am SO excited to see all there is to see!And Cuddles seems more cutesy than appropriate for my unusual good looks!I just had a bunch of puppies that came up from Texas with me. It is kind of nice to not have to keep an eye on them all the time. Sometimes I still go in Mama-mode and use my mouth to get folks to cooperate. The people remind me they aren’t my pups and I stop, but it probably would be best if there weren’tanyreally littlekids (under 4?) in my forever home. I would like it if there was another pup to play with (one of my foster brothers is an older guy who doesn’t want to play with me, so except for the occasional sniff, I leave him alone) but I’d be fine with just people too!I LOVE people! I’m so excited when my foster mom comes home that I kind of bounce up and down! I do some bouncing and dancing for food too! I like to follow foster mom around the house and see what she is up to! She will often give me some ear scratches if I’m close enough…and did I mention how much I LOVE ear scratches???I love my people so much that I whimper a bit when they leave….eitherthe house or when foster mom goes down those stairs and closes the door behind her (Foster Mom: She settles down pretty quickly). When she leaves the house, she just puts up a gate and I behave myselfpretty well. I did decide to see how tasty a shoe was one day, so now my foster mom makes sure there are no shoes where I can get them and leaves me lots of chew toys.I like tennis balls too…it is so fun to bounce and chase them down the hall!Foster mom says to tell you I totally know to do my business outside (no accidents for this girl!) and that I barkonly occasionally when I see people.Soif you are looking for a pup that will enjoy going for walks or runs or fetching a tennis ball AND also likes to hang out on the sofa and watch a little TV, come and meet me! I’d love it if you’d give me an ear scratch or two!Cuddles is currently being treated for heartworm disease.

My mom was some sort of scruffy terrier, and is about 30 pounds. I don’t know about Dad, so I’ll probably be a medium sized dog.

In my quest for new knowledge I can get into a lot of trouble so you'll need to be willing to give me lots of gentle guidance so I can learn all those big dog things, like how to behave in a house, what a crate is for, how to walk on a leash without pulling, and those verbal commands every dog should know. I may even treat people like I treat my sibling with rough play or decide that new pair of shoes or a table leg would make a great chew toy, so a lot of appropriate toys should be in my future.

His ideal adopter is someone who can give him the exercise and mental stimulation he needs.  He is just a little thing weighing in at approximately 18 pounds. Burt comes to us from a small rural shelter in Texas where he wasn't getting much interest so he's trying his luck with adopters in the northeast :-)  He is engaged and likes to be with people but true to his breed he needs to stay busy and active. He settled down so nicely after spending a good part of the day outdoors at our dog walk. Burt knows how to sit and loves his treats. Prior to coming into our care, Burt lived in a foster home with cats and dogs but his energy can be a too much for some and he can sometimes be a little testy with cats which should be considered if you have other pets. If you are looking for a  small, active, smart. loving and busy dog, Burt please consider Burt. He is 6 years old and he will be a fun and lively addition to your home and family.",

If you are interested in Blue, please contact Lisa by email at lfountain6929@gmail.com - although Blue is currently located in Texas, transport to the NJ/NY area can be arranged for the right adopter.From Blue's \""mom\"": I'd like you to meet my boy Blue, a 45 lb. neutered male Lab mix who is about 6-7 years old. He is a country dog rescued off the streets of Deep East Texas.In the home, Blue is a dream. He has never had an accident, never chewed any furniture or walls, never got into the trash and he will sit quietly while someone eats. He is incredibly loyal and loving with lots of tail wags and kisses. He loves to run in the woods and will return when called. He is a very smart dog and he knows how to Sit and Stay. He walks well on a lead. He cannot tolerate cats. He's never been around young children so that is an unknown. He is scared of loud noises, like fireworks or thunder, and will hide under my bed until the noise is gone.I live in Nacogdoches, Texas, which is a small town and I have a farm in Hemphill, Texas, that he loves. A new job requires that I move to Manhattan and I do not believe Blue will acclimate to a noisy, busy, unpredictable environment. That is why I am looking for a good home for him.Blue has anxiety from living on the streets and from whatever abuse he suffered in prior homes. He is not an angry dog - he is a fearful dog. As a result, he is defensive around strangers. I am continuing to work on his training in this regard. Recently a nurse unexpectedly walked into my mother's room and I had to restrain Blue by his collar. He nipped her leg which, while a small puncture wound, constitutes the first time he actually bit someone. She did not seek or need medical treatment.I put him in an strange environment where I knew he would be anxious - so it is my fault. If Blue was on his lead I do not believe this incident would have occurred but I took it off so he could lie next to me on the floor. Blue has never bitten anyone in the four years he has been me. I entertain in my home, walk him on a lead around town and he behaves well.Blue is a very good boy. His owner needs to be his leader and friend. He needs someone who understands a rescue with anxiety and will continue the training I began when he appeared on my porch. The best environment for Blue is probably being the only dog in the household.Please help me find a safe place for Blue to live. This sweet country boy would not do well in a city environment so I am hoping that someone with a suitable situation will open their heart & their home to him. As stated above, Blue is currently located in Texas but transport can be arranged elsewhere if someone is willing to adopt him. Thank you for your consideration.",

We feel he would do best in a home without kids or much older, calmer children.Guinness is a transfer from Fort Worth, Texas.  Guinness is a quiet guy that loves affection but is also a bit unsure about new things.  He overcomes quickly and could really use a patient new home to show him the world is full of fun!  Pupdate - Guinness met the trainer today and scored high points on the gentle, calm, well-behaved dog section!  He is not a foodie, so right now it isn't a huge motivator to him, but there have been lots of changes lately which may explain the lack of interest.  He is underweight, and when the trainer mixed in some yummy canned food with his kibble, he happily ate it all.  Notice in his photos that he stands with a front paw raise?  That is a behavior that conveys submission, and definitely shows he wants no trouble.   He did well for his temperament testing and was disinterested in the shelter cats and the rabbit in the office.  He gently approached a stranger and allowed petting, and he has displayed nice quiet manners in his kennel.  He may not have had any basic training yet, but he has lovely indoor manners and waited until he was outside to potty.  Guinness met a family with young kids, and quite, frankly, he was afraid of them.  He went and hid and tried to stay away from wherever they were. No kitties in his new house, please. He is way too focused on making them run.Guinness's adoption fee is $200.00 and includes neuter, current vaccines, microchip, free vet visit, 30 days of pet health insurance, and engraved ID tag. WE DO NOT SHIP DOGS.",

She is about 1.5 years old and she is super friendly to all and very playful and affectionate.  She is great with other dogs, she was kind of afraid of the office cat, and she knows her basic cues.  Shes a big girl, and she does pull on the leash, and she does jump up, but its because she is so friendly and loves affection.  She did great for her temperament testing and does not guard her food although she is an eager eater!Pupdate - Rogue was adopted, but returned through no fault of her own (except maybe her size with a young pup) and we learned she was great in the house and was reliably housetrained.

She was rescued by BTN from a very high kill shelter in Texas.  An awful place... She was VERY pregnant.  BTN was on their way to get her and she ended up delivering her babies at the shelter.  A supporter of BTN snatched Xena and her babies right up and fostered them until we could arrive to bring her back to PA for fostering.  Xena is a complete joy.  Grateful for everything she has been given.. Loves kids.  Has not been cat tested yet.  She is a bit guarding around other dogs but she has her 6 babies and is protective of them - understandable.  Completely fine with people around the babies though.  Her foster mom says she is a dream and is extremely sweet.  Xena has a bit of energy as you can see in her video.  Their larger baby gate had broken and this was what Xena thought of the temporary replacement.  For more info please email suew@boxertransfer.org,

He is just under 2 years old, 40lbs and was born completely blind.Chimi's story is a sad one. He was born to a backyard breeder with a birth defect that left him blind. He could not be sold due to this defect and was given away to a family member. After barely a year, his owner died while his wife was pregnant, so Chimi was given away again. He was passed through several homes, until he finally found his way into rescue.Their loss is our gain. This dog is absolutely incredible! He has been with a foster decompressing for the last few weeks and is set to get neutered tomorrow. He is a very easy boy and would make a great companion to the right home.He's a total dream dog! Chimi is leash trained and friendly with both dogs and cats. He has been a breeze to train and now knows his name and basic commands. He does well in a crate, is completely housebroken and potty trained. He is a little tank, but walks very well on leash with minimal pulling.Chimi is also extremely food motivated, responds well to correction and is eager to please when a smelly treat is passed in front of his nose. He is learning to take treats gently and is easily corrected verbally when he’s eating too fast, but is not mouthy at all.We would love to get him into a home experienced with blind dogs, or one that would learn how to properly care for him and keep up with his training. As a blind dog, Chimi relies heavily on his other senses of sound and smell to figure things out, but is very aware of his surroundings once he settles in. Don't let his disability deter you- Chimi is a total gem!Adopting from A Chance To Bloom:We are a rescue based in Houston, Texas that is currently expanding adoptions into other states.

My hobbies include taking all my plush toys out of the basket, putting all my toys on my foster moms bed, and generally anything else that has to do with plush toys. I'm really good with them though, and there hasn't been any stuffing incidents yet!The nice vet told me I'm still a baby, and am definitely under 2 years old. I'm almost 100% potty trained, and have only had a few accidents right before bed. I'm practicing my crate skills everyday, it's still a little scary, so I whine for a few minutes, but then my foster mom says I settle right down.As much as I love my foster brother, he is VERY tolerant of my puppy antics, so any potential siblings I have should be dog-savvy and just as tolerant of my lack of personal space. As for potential human siblings, I would do best around older children who I can't knock over easily (and who won't steal my plush toys). I haven't met any cats yet. My brother and I eat at the same time and I always finish first, but I know not to try and steal his food and just wait to play with him until he's done eating.Loud noises are still scary since I grew up in the sleepy town of Amarillo, but I'm getting used to the big city noises and am braver each day.I love going for long walks, but I also love snuggling with any warm body. The couch is my new favorite place, and I sleep soundly through the night on my foster mom's bed.Adoption fee is $425 to help offset travel and medical expenses.

He is estimated to be about 4 years old, currently weighs 65 lbs, and is quite tall for his breed. He must be mixed with a dog that is traditionally taller than a staffy  for sure!Jax does well on a leash and accepts redirection like a champ, he is good with all people and dogs, with a proper introduction or course and a bit of redirection if he gets over excited. Sometimes he gets so excited about meeting a new friend that he barks and sounds mean, but he’s not! He can be a little shy and weary with new dogs at first, but lord knows what his life was before he came into our rescue, so who could blame him for being cautious?! Jax is super cuddly and loving; he loves nothing more than to be near his human. He does have storm anxiety but we can guide you on making him comfortable and keeping him safe during storms. I hear WA doesn’t have thunderstorms like we do down here in TX, so that may be a perfect fit for him! ;)We are located in Houston, TX, but transport to WA to Approved adopters for an additional transport fee. Jax’s adoption fee is $175, which includes his vaccinations, neuter, and a microchip.If you are interested in adding this handsome hunk to your family, you can complete our adoption application here https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTouH1tnoNnaBVOjm4r2-fjzowN2hFGcHBkfHPOjpvRh7JJQ/viewform and follow up with us at PETronusRescue@hotmail.com",

Mom was a Great Pyrenees, dad was a Doberman, and her \""oopsy\"" litter was dropped off at a high-kill shelter in Texas. These dogs will be large (we estimate 100 lbs) when full grown and already show their wonderful breed traits -- they are intelligent, confident, well-balanced and in tune with humans. We will not be considering apartment dwellers for these (to be) extra large dogs, especially since Pyrenees do not tend to do well in apartment settings. We will continue to add more information about her so stay tuned!Foster Update: Eden is a great dog - very loving and super sweet. She is good with all people and incredibly patient with our toddler as well. She has improved greatly with her leash walking (still a little nervous with bikes) but we just keep moving and she's able to enjoy the walks! We are working on having her sit and be calm and wait before eating, though she still acts like every time is the first time she's ever eaten! Still you can take her food (or toy or bone) away without a problem. Her crate training is coming along -- she will whine a bit at first but then settles down; she is great sleeping through the night. Eden loves to be right by your side and wants all the hugs and pets she can get. She would do well with a family with kids to love on her and I'm sure she'd love another dog to run and play with as well, as she really got on with our foster dog who has since been adopted. We are still working on chewing and potty training -- even with all the bones, toys and exercise she still finds stuff to chew on. This is puppy behavior and she should outgrow it, but something to be aware of. Also, she's almost potty training but will still require ongoing diligence and potty breaks every 2-3 hours to prevent accidents.Adoption Info: Adoption fee is $500, which includes spay/neuter, current rabies/DAPPV/bordetella vaccinations, microchip, health certificate, and heartworm test.

He is a typical happy-go-lucky lab who has done well with the other dogs in his foster home. It takes him a little time to get over his shyness and then he is happy as a clam!He met a cat at the vet office and had no problems. Buddy has not met many kids at this time!When Buddy went in for his neuter, his pre-op blood work showed that he is in kidney failure. This was obviously unexpected news, particularly given the fact that he is such a young boy. He has since started on Benazepril, which will promote healthy kidney function, and a kibble recommended for dogs with kidney issues. Benazepril is an inexpensive medication - our vet has quoted us $8 per month. While we are currently working on a plan for his future care, it is impossible to say what to expect long-term. Some dogs do not live a full life, and others do. Buddy will need to have his blood work monitored once or twice a year and at some point could need subcutaneous fluids to flush his kidneys. As long as he is eating and drinking well, with normal activity, he is considered to be stable for a dog with his condition.Currently, Buddy is doing really well. He does consume a lot of water which is actually a good thing, per our vet. Drinking plenty of water will help him stay hydrated and keep his kidneys flushed. Because he drinks more than the average dog, he needs more frequent potty breaks but other than that, he is a normal pup.

She was a street dog in Texas who was picked up by the city, starving and hairless. She was diagnosed with demodex mange due to poor nutrition and lack of care. Nellie has been treated and is slowly getting her hair back (although we think she may have some hairless breed in her!) thanks to good nutrition and lots of TLC. She is dog friendly, cat friendly and kid friendly. Nellie LOVES her people, and wants nothing more than to cuddle up in your lap and shower you with kisses. She is playful with other dogs -- she likes to play chase! Once she is worn out, she grabs her favorite toy, curls up on the couch, and gently chews on her toy until bedtime. Nellie is food motivated, walks well on leash, and does well in her crate ... she fusses for a few minutes, then settles down and can sleep in her crate at night. Nellie would love a home where she can either have a canine companion to play with, or be able to have frequent play and social time. A fenced in yard is a plus! Nellie does well around kids, but would do best with older children who she can shower with kisses and affection.

Baby Jade is currently in Houston, Texas and available for transport through our rescue partners. This little girl has been in foster care for about 3 months and has  trained quickly. She is smart, learns quickly and has grown to become confident dog with a playful nature. She has learned to walk on a leash, crate train and house train quickly. She is very food motivated and will require a home that will work with her on basic obedience and gives her guidance. Baby Jade can be a little stubborn and her favorite activities include stealing peaches off the trees and searching for pecans in the grass. She can be a little stubborn at times and tends to run off and explore on her own, while the other dogs play. She plays in a group daily with other dogs, both male and female, ranging from young pups to adults, and does great with all of them. She loves to wrestle and roughhouse, if the other dog will allow. When another dog sets boundaries with Baby Jade by barking, growling or correcting her with a bite to the neck, she will back down and go into puppy mode by running away. Baby Jade is dog friendly and great with kids.She is about 50lbs now and still growing. She recently had a growth spurt and is in that awkward puppy stage where she has skinny body and long, lanky legs. Baby Jade will be a large dog when fully grown, from 80-90lbs, and has an incredibly sweet temperament. She is medium to high activity, and would be an amazing companion for runs, hikes or just a nice casual stroll around the park.Baby Jade is at an age where she needs guidance and would thrive in an environment with another assertive and more confident dog. She does well with dominant female dogs and takes correction well, however may persist in roughhousing until her human steps in to correct her as she is all about playing. This girl is a tomboy and lives for mud puddles and water- don't let her good looks fool you into thinking she is a girly girl! She is also extremely vocal and \""sings\"" when she is hungry, displeased or bored, so be prepared to always have someone talking to you and letting you know how she feels! Baby Jade has a high prey drive towards rodents, such as squirrels, rats and possum outdoors. We have not tested Baby Jade with cats, but she is very calm and submissive. She could likely be trained to accept cats, with strict reinforcement.Background: Baby Jade had a rough start to life in the streets of Houston, Texas. She was found with a broken tail and infected, butchered ears from an amateur crop job at only 6 months old. She came to us as a stray, found by a Good Samaritan who saved her life after seeing a man beat and kick her on the street for approaching his dog while on a walk. He said she was vicious and tried to throw her into oncoming traffic. Vetting: Baby Jade has received the standard DHLPP vaccine, rabies vaccine and Bordatella vaccine. She is spayed, microchipped and heartworm negative. We recommend that all rescue dogs coming from Texas remain on heartworm preventative for 6 months after arriving in Washington, as a precaution.Adopting from A Chance To Bloom:We are a rescue based in Houston, Texas that is currently expanding adoptions into other states.

Diana came to us from a shelter in Texas along with her siblings. They were all adopted and she was held back due to a few medical issues that were being discovered. Turns out, Diana has a bit of a sight problem due to a neurological issue. It is not yet known if the problem is a brain stem or mild hydrocephalus problem at this point. She is growing and developing fine but does have some mental development issues. She is unaware of where her feet are sometimes and doesn't recognize her own size and strength. She can see, but only out of the bottom half of her eyes, so down low. She plays rough like most cattle dogs but also thinks nothing of pouncing with all her weight! She has proven to be harder to housebreak, because of her delayed mental development. She is doing great with dogs that like to rough house but proves to be too much for little dogs. She loves people she knows and loves to snuggle but struggles with new experiences, places and strangers. She is a bit of a special girl and will always need special accommodations for her mental development. A fully fenced yard and possibly another dog that has her play style would be required.Adoption contract and fee applies. All adoptable dogs can be met at adoption events hosted every weekend. For a list of scheduled events go to: https://www.facebook.com/SmidgetRescue/events . Smidget Rescue is not a shelter, and dogs cannot be seen at the Rescue location.

The shelter she came from had a only 32% survival rate on canines last year. Xena has a severe case of luxating patella in one of her back legs so she cannot use the leg. She has been evaluated by a vet and surgery is not an option on her leg due to age.

She loves cuddling in bed at night, and does NOT like being crated.

Gender: Female, spayedAge: 4 years oldSize:  Medium (50-55lbs)Good with…..Dogs:  Yes, most dogs! Cats: Nope, sorry!Kids: 13+HistoryI have been through quite a bit in my 4 years!  I landed in a very crowded shelter in Thailand, knowing there was something not right with my back legs.  I struggled to get around and I was in a lot of pain.  Thankfully some kind people stepped in and rescued me!  They were wonderful to me!  They gave a nice place to rest, and plenty of food and water but they realized that I needed more help with my injuries, so they contacted Willow from Willow’s Wings Animal Sanctuary and she agreed to take me into her adoption sanctuary!  I was put on a plane and flew half way around the world.    Who knew that a shelter dog would end up as a world traveler!!!  I landed in snowy New York where Willow and her fur friends welcomed me with open arms!  They took me right away to the Cornell University Vet Hospital where a team of veterinarians discovered that my kneecaps were displaced.  Ack!  Big problem, but they promised me that they would make me good as new., which as you can imagine, was quite a relief to hear!  It meant I would be able to do things I’ve always dreamt of doing, like running and playing, and not being in pain all the time!  I had two surgeries which meant an awful lot of recuperating time resting in my crate, but  I didn’t really mind, I knew it would be all worth it.  My legs are all healed up now and I am as good as new!  I can finally enjoy life to its fullest and no pain!  There is only one thing missing…….a home of my very own.  But everyone promises me that they will find me a fabulous forever home sometime soon!!PersonalityHere are some fun facts about me:I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE belly rubs!  I will happily roll on my back and enjoy belly rubs for as long as you would like to give them!!I really enjoy a good squeaky toy!  I will also happily play with balls!  I like to “talk.”  Some may misunderstand and think I am talking in Wookie or mistake it for grumbling or growling, but I promise you, that is how I talk, and I love communicating with you!  When I want attention, I like to use my feet to get you to pet me. Haha!  I am gentle about it, it’s kind of adorable and hilarious I am told, it’s my way of asking “please pet me, scratch me, love me!”I have some random moments of silly playfulness, but in general I am pretty laid back and I am perfectly happy lounging around the house chilling!Currently, some say I am a bit on the “fluffy” side (aka, a teensy bit overweight), but that’s how it goes when you are recovering from major surgery and are forced to be in a crate for long periods of time ( I may or may not have watched a lot of Price Is Right and enjoyed some snack foods during my recovery time!!).   I have overheard some people talk about a diet and exercise plan.  I’m in, let’s go! I love to go for walks!I enjoy going for leashed walks.  I walk nicely with a martingale collar.  My people tell me that I am secure wearing one of those.  And I like the thought of being safe and secure.  We won’t be able to go for long walks due to my knee limitations, but I like short walks!  I prefer to take walk in calm, peaceful places.  Busy streets or parks are not really my thing, that would make me uncomfortalbe.  And dog parks….oh my..no thank you, way too busy and too much going on!Let me tell you one very important thing about me.  While I am very (very!) loving and affectionate to those whom I love and trust, I am still quite cautious and nervous when meeting new people and when in unfamiliar situations.  And I very much prefer when things are calm and quiet.  I would love to meet calm, patient, and understanding people that will allow me to shine at my own pace.  It takes me time to become comfortable with new things.  The very best thing you could do for me when meeting me would be to sit on the floor, and kind of ignore me (staring at me would make me nervous), and just give me time.  Wait for me to come to you.  Perhaps toss some yummy treats in my direction, but then just sit there and read a magazine and give me some time.  When I do approach, move slowly, speak softly, and don’t reach out toward me, just let me come to you while you stay where you are. And  if I back away, please don’t get discouraged, I’m simply not ready yet.  This may take some time, but please be patient with me… I promise you I am well worth it, and once I get to know you, I am the most lovely wonderful girl you could ever hope to find.  My rescue folks says I need a home with a securely fenced in yard and I would have to agree.  I do like feeling safe and secure.  I could play and explore with you in yard, that would be fun!  Another fantastic way for us to bond!I should also mention… I am a bit of a celebrity!  “The Dodo” did a story on me.  It’s a lovely story about my journey up to this point.  It has over 64,000 views on youtube!!  You should really take the time to check out my story, you can find it at:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orsMz-fTR1wCohabitationI need a very special adopter.  I am seeking calm, caring, understanding, positive, and patient people.  Someone who is gentle and nurturing and patient and sweet.  Experience with shy and cautious dogs would be a huge bonus.  I would not do well with inexperienced people.  Ideally I would love to find a home with a person or persons that have a calm, quiet, laid back lifestyle.I might enjoy sharing a home with a quiet, well-mannered dog friend.  I have done best with male dogs--sometimes I like to be in charge, and sometimes other dogs (especially other females) do not appreciate that type of lady.  If you do have another dog, I would for sure be willing to meet up.  Perhaps we could go for a nice walk and get to know one another!  Hopefully we would hit it off great.I have never been around children.  I hear they can be quite active and sometimes make lots of loud sounds and zip around, which isn’t a fit for me.  I like things calm and on the quieter side, so I feel that the best fit for me is home without children or high activity.  Cats you ask?  Very sorry, I seem to like to chase, so probably would not work for me to live with cats.  MedicalI have had two major surgeries on my hind legs to repair my displaced kneecaps.  My rescue mom and Cornell have all of my paperwork.  They will be happy to share that with you.  I get around like a champ now!  I love short walks but should not do long walks/hikes and should not go jogging or do things that require jumping (like agility).These are a few of my favorite things...Squeaky toys!        Balls!        Belly rubs!         Ear scratches!Waving!     Talking!      Short walks!      Napping in a cozy place!    Basking in the sunshine!SummaryI am such a very special girl and I have so much to offer.  All I need is a little patience because I can be shy with new people and new situations, but once we have a chance to get to know each other, I will be the most loving, sweet, and loyal dog you have ever had. I’ve been waiting so long for the right person.  Come and meet me please!***Chemelea is a courtesy posting for Willow's Wings Animal Sanctuary in Endicott NY, and they will make all decisions about Chamelea's placement.

They prefer access to the home or being in a room behind a baby gate.OTHER DOGS: While she lived in Thailand with other dogs, she does prefer to be on her own. She tends to avoid other dogs and will grumble when they get in her face. If they keep their distance, she will ignore them. She would do best in a home without other dogs and get more confidence training.CATS: She's a little too friendly and curious. No cats in the home would be best.CHILDREN: Dog-respectful children, 8 and older. Olivia is wonderful with people.ADOPTION DONATION: $400HEALTH:Olivia is spayed, microchipped, flea treated, dewormed, and is current on vaccines.She is a tripod (3 legs). Her leg was amputated due to a dog fight and a severe wound to her leg. This certainly does NOT slow her down- please check out her videos, which show exactly how nimble she is!She does have a luxating patella in her hind limb, which would mean she should forgo strenuous hikes; however, is amenable to leisurely neighborhood walks.Your adoption donation goes toward offsetting the cost of her vet care as well as other incidental costs of care.HISTORY: Olivia came to us from Phuket, Thailand from Soi Dog Foundation.NOTES FROM FOSTER HOME:Olivia is the sweetest happiest dog and is quick to greet you with a tail wag and likes to follow you around the home or lay next to you on the bed or couch. While she does prefer to be in your presence she's not an intrusive dog, nor overly needy and in your face. In all, Olivia is pretty quiet and inquisitive as well as respectful.She looooooves watching tv and especially nature shows! If she hears David Attenborough's voice she comes running. She follows all the action and gets really invested. Sometimes it's like being in a live version of Mystery Science Theatre ;) She also likes watching animated movies with dogs and pretty much anything else that's on.She likes toys to chew on and is happy to share them with you- as well, she's treat motivated. She also knows to go to the \""right\"" part of the yard to do her business reliably.While she does tolerate environments where there are other dogs in close proximity, she would probably prefer to have a home and family of her own- especially as the loss of her leg was due to a dog attack. Understandably, there is a certain proximity that she is comfortable with and if dogs persist in invading her space, she will grumble and may snap as a warning. She has done nothing beyond this, but we also don't want her pushed- and while she is who she is in many ways, she would still benefit from more confidence building and socialization where she has many positive experiences to help her overcome the negative ones she remembers.Olivia is a fabulously friendly, sweet dog with all people, she just needs some space form other dogs- and is a little too interested in cats...we know there are plenty families looking for an easy going, sweet, adult dog to welcome into their home!Here's another video to check out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViheZv3MtC4&feature=youtu.beAll dogs adopted from Motley Zoo come with a leash and Martingale collar (or a harness, if necessary), depending on each dog's particular needs.

My name is Hanny! Pleasure to meet you! If you have a spare moment, I’d love to tell you a bit about myself. I’m about 5-years-old and they say my ears are soft as velvet! My temperament? It’s PAWsum! I’m a friendly boy and a hound through and through. In addition, I’m a good playmate with other doggies. I have never been around meowing friends so I don’t know how I feel about whiskered pals. The rescue thinks I would be okay around kids because I’m so easy going - but they haven’t had a chance to watch me around little humans yet. I came to rescue as a transfer from a shelter in Virginia because my time was up and the shelter was full so they had to make some difficult decisions. Some volunteers really thought I was a cool dog and rallied to get me to a rescue group. I’m so happy I got a second chance! I will be neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and tested for Heartworm prior to official adoption. My energy level is moderate. I’d love someone who can take me on walks or someone who loves the outdoors. I will be your very best pal! If you have a fenced-in yard, that would be a dream for me! I love sniffing fresh air! I’d love to meet you! Please, consider me?",

He came to us from rural VA where he was found as a stray. No one came to reclaim him so we scooped him up to give him his second chance! Forest gets along well with other dogs and loves attention from humans! He is a large dog who prefers to be a part of a pack and would prefer to go to a home with another canine buddy. He exhibits strong husky behaviors and would be better suited for somebody who has experience with the breed. He would be happiest in a home with a fenced-in yard.Your new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.Adoption fees cover basic vetting, spay/neuter surgery (for dogs over 6 months old), rabies, distemper/parvo vaccinations, treatment for worms, heartworm testing, monthly heartworm prevention and monthly flea/tick prevention (while the animal is in our care), and transport costs from high-kill shelter. Please note that on average, K-9 Lifesavers spend significantly more on each dog than their adoption fee. Adoption fee for HW positive dog also covers heartworm treatment at our partner vets.Foster Program: Foster homes provide for the temporary care of a rescue until the dog is placed into a loving, forever home.

According to my vet records I lived in a very rural setting with very little (if any) exposure to city noise and people. My foster home is in “the city” so I’m learning what all these new sounds are. Since I’ve had little to no exposure to new people, my foster mom has been helping me learn that new people are good. I like to go and hide and observe new people from a distance and will eventually warm up to new people especially if you give me treats.  I love being outside and rough housing with my foster fur sis. I also love to play fetch and I love all the toys (especially squeaky ones). I like making a pile of all the toys so if I get tired of one, I can play with another - I like keeping my options open. I know where to do my business (outside) and I sleep really good in my kennel. I’d sleep in the bed with you too – I’m the perfect little spoon. I love to go on walks, and I’ve explored a few trails here in Arkansas and I prefer those to a crowded park.  My forever home must have: •	Home with a fenced in yard•	Treasure trove of squeaky toys•	Parent(s) who are at home or can come check on me during the day•	Companion pet – I need someone that can show me the ropes and keep me company while my humans are away•	No cats •	No young kiddos – they’re cute but they make me nervousTRANSPORT AVAILABLE TO APPROVED HOMES!

I am from Virginia and was probably a bird dog who did some hunting and then got lost and found my way to PRO. Now I am a somewhere between a year and two years old, living in my foster home in Northern Virginia, and loving every minute of it!I am currently living with and getting along great with a bossy 3-year-old female dog and a guinea pig.  I have a lot of fun playing with my foster sister.  We love to wrestle, play tag and tug of war.  I’m very well behaved and never get upset when she bosses me around.  I am eager to please and super friendly with people, including kids, dogs and maybe cats. My foster folks think that I would make a wonderful family dog. I would make fast friends with kids, but you might have to watch me around young ones because I still like to jump up.  I would do well with folks who have time to play outside because I love to walk, run, and I think I would really like a dog park.  Whomever I end up with, I hope they will like to play fetch with me. I bring the ball right back to hand. I’m working on basic obedience commands, like ‘sit’ and ‘come’.  I love riding in the car and willing jump right in. I am 100% housebroken. I even use the doggie doorbells to let my foster folks know when I need to go out. I am still young and need appropriate treats and toys to exercise my jaws. I have had a few issues chewing, so I need to go in my crate if I’m not being watched.  I love all kinds of toys and will happily entertain myself with them, but did I mention that I really like to retrieve balls?  When I’m not playing with toys, I’m very cuddly and affectionate. I love to lie in the sun in the afternoons and snuggle up on the sofa in the evening for TV time.   I’ve been with my foster family for four weeks, so they would like you to know that I’m still working on a few things, like leash walking. I don’t pull nearly as badly as some, and I am getting better with practice. I am not used to being crated. I am definitely not a fan and will be sure to voice my displeasure. I don’t mind sleeping in my crate at night, but during the day, I want to be where the action is.  Finally, I want to be around my people above all else. My hope would be to find someone who is around a good bit, perhaps retired, working from home, or able to take me to work with them.  If that’s not possible, I would also probably really like doggy day care.  At home, a fenced in yard would be needed, (you know how hard it is for us dogs to resist the temptation of a squirrel or bird). I am very treat motivated and a quick learner, so I could be trained to an invisible fence. I am fully-grown and weigh 56 pounds.  The vet says I should put on a few more pounds and I’m really enjoying trying to do that.  I was recently microchipped and neutered. I am current on all required vaccinations and put on a monthly flea/tick and heartworm preventatives. I have also been dewormed. I am well behaved for nail trimming, ear cleaning, bathing and brushing.  The vet said I’m a perfect gentleman.  TRANSPORT AVAILABLE TO APPROVED HOMES!

They wanted to travel and had no one to take care of Sampson, so they dumped him at the shelter. Sampson is very unsocialized, but is improving. Once he warms up to a person, he is very social and lovable. At the shelter, one of the Animal Control Officers would sing to him and he would do the “Akita Happy Dance”. He is currently being kenneled and adores the kennel owner. He is slowly coming out of his shell, day by day, person by person. When he was initially transported from Lee County to Richmond Va, he was so terrified at the transfer point that he just flattened on the ground. He had to be lifted into the second transport vehicle. He showed no aggression at any point during his handling. In a couple of weeks, the kennel owner was able to get him in the car with a little coaxing to take him to the vet. Again, while fearful of the circumstances, he was great with the vet and the staff. Here is what the volunteers who went to walk him had to say:'Samson notes: He is a big boy! He is shy, and a bit slow to warm up (of course all of them absolutely adore Stacey - comments are limited to how the dogs react to us). He's not aggressive - just wary. Walks reasonably well on lead, and actually seemed to enjoy his walk-about.' He seems to be one of those dogs who has to warm up to each person he meets, but then is polite and even sociable.Sampson is looking for a foster home to help him on his journey towards adoption.",

Now that she is healthy and happy; we can confidently say that she has a long way to go before she is a senior. We now call her Scooter; which better describes her personality and her propensity to get frequent attacks of the Zoomies.She came to us from a rural shelter in southwestern Virginia. She was malnourished, infested with intestinal parasites, and her fur was coming out in clumps. We were also concerned that she may be pregnant. During her wellness check, it was discovered she was indeed pregnant, but the vet felt something was wrong. An ultrasound was preformed and we found out her babies were not viable.  She needed emergency surgery.  If we had waited few more days; she may have not survived.  After a few weeks of recovery at her new foster home in South Carolina; the real Scooter showed herself.. Her coat is soft, full and beautiful. She loves to run around her wooded fenced property chasing away squirrels and any other critter bold enough to trespass.  Due to this, we think she would do best in a home without cats.  She likes going for leash walks and really loves to snuggle with her foster mom.  Scooter gets along with her big ACD foster brother, but is not very fond of other female dogs.  Scooter is deaf, She may hear really low and high pitched loud sounds. For this reason, we feel a fenced yard is really important for her safety.  She is learning some sign language.  Like most ACD's Scooter is wary of new people until she gets to know them; then she quickly warms up for petting and treats.. She is a goofy, happy girl.  She is crate trained and likes to go for car rides. She has been a very good girl at all of her vet visits and with everyone she traveled with on her journey from Bristol, VA to Richmond, VA and onto Summerville, SC She is still learning about toys, squeaky ones are really fun.We think Scooter is about  4yrs old, and 35 LBS, She is Heartworm negative, up to date on her vaccinations, crate trained, house trained, spayed, and being fostered near Summerville, SCIf you are interested in adopting Scooter, please visit the Adoption Process page on our website – http://carolinasrescue.com/Adoption_Process.html. You can download our Adoption Questionnaire there, then email it to us at adoptions@carolinasrescue.com. That will start the process.",

He arrived as a stray, though the employees strongly thought that the people that turned him in were in fact his owners. He's an adorable 20 lb terrier mix, and while we really have no clue what he is mixed with, he resembles a cairn terrier with the size and curled tail of aSpitz.He is estimated to be approximately 2 years old. He's done great with other dogs and is brushing up on his housebreaking routine. He has a little bit of a pushy terrier attitude and doesn't like fast movements towards him, so we are restricting him to a home with no young children at this time. He walks great on a leash and is enjoying all the attention that he can get. He is fully vetted, microchipped, neutered and maintained on flea/tick/heartworm prevention. His adoption fee is $200 which helps to offset his veterinary expenses. For more information on Tiki, email petlover_42@yahoo.com.",

Dette was deemed a dangerous animal in the state of Virginia. Her previous owner would not keep her confined and she was allowed to roam at will. She is happy and gregarious and would run up to people and knock them down as a game. She's not shown any aggressive side to us at all but we all know how to tell her \""GET OFF\"" and she's respecting that cue. She needs some training and someone with some common sense.

Without exception and it needs to be a solid, dependable fence and you need to plan to be in control of your dog.What kind of home would be best for me? Dette's perfect owner will be someone with dog experience, who loves to take long, brisk walks and who would enjoy teaching, shaping and training their dog to be the excellent companion this dog has the potential to be. Dette is affectionate and friendly and longs for that companion that will be her partner, her friend and her guide through life instead of letting him run amuck.What is my personality like? Dette is a wide open kind of girl with zero attention span right now because no one has asked anything of her. That needs to change. She is a highly intelligent dog and because she has been allowed to run and roam she got into trouble. She was part of a pack with her brother Dood and was allowed too much freedom and not enough structure and training.One of our temperament programs is to take our dogs off site for adventures. Dette is a good girl in the car. She notices things but does not necessarily hyper focus on any one thing. She enjoyed the trip in the car just as she enjoyed the trip from Virginia to South Carolina.How do I act when I first meet new people? Cautious at first and then she warms up.Other tips and tidbits: Estimated Birthdate: 4/15/2015. Dette is a lot of dog with a lot of things going for her. She has been given a very bad rap and very nearly lost her life because her previous owner had no common sense. We are going to be extraordinarily picky about her next home to make sure it's her best home and her forever home.Dood and Dette are brother and sister and that is a problem. They will not be placed together. They egg each other on. They need separate homes and to go live their own lives.House trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.Please note - we do not ship dogs.

Whatever he is, he is gorgeous and affectionate.Titus was adopted from us as an older puppy in January and returned because living with toddlers proved to be too stressful for him. As such, he cannot go to a home with children under 12 years old (out of an abundance of caution).This dog needs A LOT of exercise... seriously, take what you think is an appropriate amount of exercise for an older puppy and at least double it. His previous adopters struggled initially because they weren't giving him anywhere near he amount of exercise he needed. Because their schedules didn't allow for running with him or spending time at the dog park, we suggested day care and that absolutely did the trick and helped him be a calm boy indoors.In his final month with his previous adopters, he began to exhibit resource guarding tendencies (with the children only). In his current foster home, he only exhibits some mild resource guarding with the resident dog; the humans are able to handle his bowl and food, take it away, etc. with no issues. That all said, Titus' forever family will need to be mindful and careful, only feeding him in his crate and not introducing high value toys or treats until he is settled in.Titus also has separation anxiety, which seems to be on the mild end of the spectrum as it became better when his previous adopters provided adequate exercise. His current foster family reports no signs of separation anxiety, but they do have a second dog, which sometimes can help alleviate milder cases. As such, Titus would do best in a home with a confident second dog. Either way, his adopter will need to commit to working with an approved trainer to help him overcome his anxiety since having a second dog is merely a band-aid and doesn't address the underlying issues. He could also use some training on greeting visitors (he's a jumper!) and just being more gentle and polite in general. He is a smart boy and a quick learner... it helps that he is very treat motivated.If you're scared off, then Titus is not the dog for you. If you are an experienced Doodle person and/or have managed mild separation anxiety and mild resource guarding, then you just might be a good match for this boy.Please note that we will be evaluating applicants VERY carefully to ensure his next forever home will truly be his forever home. We are all-volunteer and suspect we will be flooded with applications, so please be patient as we do our job and match him to the best adopter. When he has a pending adopter, we will note it on this profile.Titus is very affectionate with his humans and other dogs, and did well with cats as a younger pup, though he realistically may have too much energy to enable a peaceful existence for a resident cat. This boy needs a bit of work, but he is so worth it and will repay you with undying loyalty and companionship.Like most shelter dogs, Titus may need a refresher on housetraining and crate training. We ask all of DC PAWS’ fosters to work on both house and crate training with their foster dog.If you are interested in adopting Titus, please submit an adoption application at http://dcpawsrescue.org/adoption-application/.DC PAWS Rescue does our best to provide accurate and complete information about our adoptable animals. Please note that we cannot make any guarantees about age or breed; we rely upon our rescue partners and their veterinarians to make those assessments. We also cannot make any guarantees about housebreaking and animal temperament, as animals can behave differently through transition and in different environments.Our shelter partners provide a basic vet screening for each animal we rescue, which includes necessary vaccinations, deworming, microchipping, and spay/neuter (unless the animal is too young or otherwise deemed by the vet to not be a good candidate for surgery). Please note that this is not a comprehensive medical exam and as such, may not identify any and all medical issues, though our goal is to flag any obvious health issues through the basic vet screening. We share all medical records with adopters and flag any known issues prior to adoption finalization.

She has been with her current family since she was adopted from a local shelter as a puppy. They are heartbroken to lose her, but feel that Juliet would be a happier dog with a different family/home situation. She is a beautiful and spunky 4 yr young 75 lb lab mix, spayed, current on all vaccines and no health issues and perfectly house trained. Juliet adores people and kids (because of her energy and strength she should be watched around small children). She is the biggest lover of people - loyal, affectionate, intelligent, highly trainable, protective, energetic, strong, sweet, in need of human love and interaction, good listener, senses emotion, loves to hang with her owners, needs daily exercise, needs routine, needs alpha management. She is a wonderful protector of home and family and will bark loudly and menacingly at strangers who approach the house until she officially meets them. She is anxious away from her owners and does not do well in kennels, she needs in-home boarding (at owner's home or in home of sitter.)Juliet is an alpha dog and needs a firm and consistent hand which is not possible in her current situation. Juliet’s ideal owner would be an experienced and alpha dog owner (single person, couple or family with children experienced with dogs) who could love and spend time with her, manage her firmly, and keep a routine for her. She does fine when home alone during the day as long as she knows her owners will return after work. She will do better with fewer handlers who can use the same training methods with her (e.g. we have too many handlers -- nanny, babysitters, housekeeper, dog walker, husband, wife, kids) Active owners - and with a yard - would be ideal.Juliet cannot be with other dogs at this time - while she loves certain dogs that she knows, she has shown aggression with other dogs. She loves flirting with cats on walks, but it is unknown how she would do with a cat in the home. She shows aggression towards large dogs and needs active training before any further interaction with dogs. Juliet should not interact off leash with dogs until further training. Her current dog trainer located in Washington, DC has offered free training to the new owners.All requests for information will be handled by Juliet’s owner and should be directed to Katie at 202-258-2362 or email rehomingjuliet@gmail.com.",Virginia

Although we did not get much information on his background, we understand he was reported to be mostly kept outside and had a slight apprehension towards men.  The trainer had a male stranger greet him and although he was alert and watchful, he did obey the cue to sit and nicely took a treat.  This shows us that Brew can work through any fear of men as long as he is given choices and not forced, and as long as positive rewards are used to create a happy association.  Brew is about 2.5 years old, he is fine with other dogs, and we will post more as we get to know him better.  Staff guesses as to his breed mix include Shepherd, Lab, Rhodesian Ridgeback, and maybe even Australian heeler.Brew's adoption fee is $175 and includes neuter, current vaccines, microchip, free vet visit, 30 days free pet health insurance, and custom engraved ID tag.",Washington

Rosa will be an awesome addition to a family that can give her the attention, exercise, training and affection she deserves.Due to the fact that this is a mixed breed puppy, we, nor our vets, cannot guarantee the size that your dog will be.Health:Rosahas been spayed and microchipped. She is current on her DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies. She has been wormed and flea treated.She has been tested for heart worm.She has been diagnosed with recurrent struvite bladder crystals and requires a special diet.History: Rosa comes from a local Washington shelter. PUP was asked to help and we are happy to help her find her forever home!Notes from Rosa's Foster Home: Since coming to PUP, this extra-sweet girl has proven to be such a delightful dog! Very shy and unsure at first, Rosa has made great strides and her true personality is shining through. It didn’t take long for her to wiggle her way into our hearts!Rosa is crate trained and housetrained on a schedule. She gets very excited when she sees her leash and has no trouble doing a 3+ mile walk. This smart girl is very food-motivated when training and we work on basic commands every day, such as ‘sit’, ‘wait’, ‘leave it’ and ‘off’. She really enjoys toys and playing with other dogs. She is proving to be a great little retriever, too! Rosa has become much more comfortable when out and about. She loves to be busy during the day and then snuggle on an open lap come evening. During the cold months, her most favorite place in the house is in a cozy bed in front of the fireplace. Her daily antics are so amusing and she makes us laugh and smile every day.Whatever may be part of her past has caused Rosa to be cautious around strangers and she prefers getting to know people slowly and in her own time. She requires a calm, predictable routine and time to feel comfortable in new surroundings and with new people. However, once comfortable, look out! She just explodes with personality!Rosa has been diagnosed with ‘bladder crystals’. Crystals are concentrates of naturally occurring minerals in a dog's urine which can occur due to abnormal urine pH. Rosa requires a strict diet of a prescription food to manage this issue. She needs to have water available at all times as well as the opportunity to get outside frequently. The cost of her food runs about $15 per month.We are looking for a family who will continue provide Rosa with loving, patient companionship and is also willing to manage her urinary issues; this includes not being gone for more than a few hours at a time during the day. Rosa would also enjoy having a playful canine companion in her new home. Having a fireplace is also a plus! She will do best in a home with easy access to a yard so she can get outside often.Rosa is truly ‘a keeper’ and it will be very hard to let her go! She looks forward to wiggling her way into your heart!Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the dog's foster home. Although PUP provides adopters up to the minute information on our dogs, we cannot guarantee they will behave in the same manner in a different environment with new owners.ADOPTION: If you think you have room in your home and heart for this dog and you reside within Washington State, please go to our Adoption Information page, or copy and paste this link https://www.pupdogrescue.org/adopt.html in your browser.

I am a Neutered Male Labrador Retriever and Pit Bull Terrier. The shelter staff think I am about 3 years old. I have been at the shelter since Apr 24, 2019.  Meet Tommy! This sweet boy was transferred to the shelter from one of our partner shelters in central Washington because they had too many dogs. Tommy was a shelter favorite at his previous shelter - his goofy and affectionate personality won over everyone he met. He is social, active, and always down to play. Tommy has been adopted a returned a few times so he really is looking for a family that can commit to meeting his needs and has the time and patience to do a lot of training. This boy has been through a lot, but he is the forgive and forget type - with his charming nature he makes friends easily. Tommy would do great with training based on positive reinforcement, he is highly motivated by food, attention and toys. He is ready for an active lifestyle with plenty of exercise, so apartment living is not a good fit and he is best suited for older kids or adults.

He is a happy, goofy, sweet guy who enjoys getting pets, snuggling, playing fetch and chewing on bones. He is still young and excitable so he'll need a patient, understanding family that's dedicated to continuing his training. Seymour is such a smart boy and learns new commands and tricks very quickly. Because of his size and intelligence, we feel he will do best with a dog-savvy leader. He is leash trained, crate trained, place trained and knows many commands including sit, down, shake, no, and come. Being a hunting breed, he has a prey drive so he'll need a forever home without cats. Seymour plays really well with other dogs once he has a slow, proper introduction. (When he first meets dogs he can be a bit over-excited/anxious and needs help introducing himself properly.) He loves to run and we would love to see him go to a home that can give him lots of activity or a yard to do zoomies in!

She is a talkative lady which is true to her breed and is always ready to let you know what is going on with her distinctive Hound bay. Her moniker is fitting in more ways than one as she loves to chatter and to chat with her human friends. Being a Hound means that Chatter's nose is always on the go and she always knows when you have recently had lunch and will sniff out any crumbs left over. She is pretty much a canine vacuum, and we say that with fondness, and her nose is sniffing out the next treat it can find!Chatter is a recent transplant from our rescue partner in West Virginia, and from her physical state it seems as if this lady had recently had a litter or puppies or had had previous litters.

She was relinquished to our shelter on April 1 by a couple that really didn't know much about their dog so trying to find her a forever home, let alone writing this bio, was tough.  They stated she was hyper.  They also stated she came from Wisconsin and the couples parents recently returned her to them in Shelbyville.  She lived with children ages two months, twins that are ten, a twelve and thirteen year old.  When in our meet and greet room she acted like she had never seen or played with a toy before and that is when she would really turn on the charm.  Since she hadn't been vetted since ???? she was a great candidate for Vet Tech Institute.  We thought America found her forever home, but she's a bit of an odd duck and was unpredictable with the woman's boyfriend.  From  quick adoption from Vet Tech we learned a bit more about America.  Fans of Bull Terriers we rarely get them at our shelter, although her coloring we feel she is a mix.  She is spayed, microchipped through AVID, current on rabies and all vaccinations, wormed and tested negative for heartworm.

He loves other dogs, a perfect lap dog who loves to snuggle. Teddy is good with children although still a little shy. Teddy is learning to be a dog. He is learning to walk on a leash. Currently he is not housebroken but we're working on it and he is catching on. He doesn't mind wearing belly bands.Teddy would make a great companion dog for a quiet home, and also appreciates stretching out on the lawn , soaking in sunshine.My adoption fee, including MN state taxes, is $214.55. I'm available to adopt within a 50 mile radius of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis/Saint Paul.To submit an adoption application, please clickhereto fill out an online application.",

Her wishes before she passed away was for him to live with her closest friend Linda in Pennsylvania. Our family made the arrangements for Alphie Jo to fly out from Wisconsin to PA 3 years ago. Linda was also my aunt’s best friend, a dog lover like you’ve never met, and she owns a rescue as well.Unfortunately Alphie Jo did not do so well living with her male dogs so she decided it was time to put him up for adoption through her rescue. He went in and out of two homes and was back at her rescue. I spent a lot of time in Wisconsin...taking care of my aunt and Alphie Jo. I formed a bond with him through a difficult time. As a dog lover, I couldn’t bear another moment of hearing him “being returned”. Last December I made the decision to take him to my home in Lafayette, NJ. He is still with me, and I wish it could always remain that way. But I have learned he cannot be around other pets no matter the size, species, or gender. He needs a home that fits him.Alphie Jo is a 6-year-old English Coonhound - he is up to date on his shots. Here is more information about him:-He cannot live with any other pets. He is unpredictable in that sense.-He has been around children of all ages however we would feel more comfortable with him being with older, experienced children, if children at all.-He is better suited in a country setting.-He howls when he wants food, water, needs to go “potty”, greets new friends, sees a stray cat outside, sees deer or bears (amazing protector for you when it comes to bears!)-He is NOT a hunting dog although his nose says otherwise.-He hates the rain and snowfall. I have a special coat for him on those days but doesn’t always work!-He loves to cuddle as close as possible to you. He’s a sleeper and definitely enjoys his sleep!-He loves to sleep under blankets-He needs an experienced dog owner-He is better with a fenced-in yard however, I don’t have one. It takes a lot more work to handle not having a fenced in yard but it can be done.Alphie Jo is NOT with Eleventh Hour Rescue but we are helping his owner with the rehoming process. If you have a situation where Alphie Jo would thrive and be safe & you'd like to meet him, please contact Stacey at samiller76@me.com or at 973 271 0856.",New Jersey
